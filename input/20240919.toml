Most recently, I am working on one that does its best to emulate the Intel 8080 chip, mostly because I came across a Space Invaders ROM and wanted to play that. The choice to tinker with these things was also because I wanted/needed an &ldquo;excuse&rdquo; to write some &ldquo;real-world&rdquo; Rust code for a project. In my day-to-day life I write a lot of Java, big-data stuff, and other crap."

arXiv:2409.11797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show Kazhdan-Lusztig categories, that is, the categories of lower bounded generalized weight modules for certain affine vertex operator superalgebras that are locally finite modules of the underlying finite dimensional Lie superalgebra, are semisimple. Those are all representation categories of affine vertex operator superalgebras at conformal but non admissible levels. As a consequence, the categories of finite length generalized modules for these affine vertex operator superalgebras have braided tensor category structures."""

arXiv:2308.05024v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{G}$ be a locally compact quantum group, and $A,B$ von Neumann algebras on which $\mathbb{G}$ acts. We refer to these as $\mathbb{G}$-dynamical W$^*$-algebras. We make a study of $\mathbb{G}$-equivariant $A$-$B$-correspondences, that is, Hilbert spaces $\mathcal{H}$ with an $A$-$B$-bimodule structure by $*$-preserving normal maps, and equipped with a unitary representation of $\mathbb{G}$ which is equivariant with respect to the above bimodule structure. Such structures are a Hilbert space version of the theory of $\mathbb{G}$-equivariant Hilbert C$^*$-bimodules. We show that there is a well-defined Fell topology on equivariant correspondences, and use this to formulate approximation properties for them. Within this formalism, we then characterize amenability of the action of a locally compact group on a von Neumann algebra, using recent results due to Bearden and Crann. We further consider natural operations on equivariant correspondences such as taking opposites, composites and crossed products, and examine the continuity of these operations with respect to the Fell topology.'''

content = '''
arXiv:2312.16573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral higher spin gravity is defined in terms of a strong homotopy algebra of pre-Calabi-Yau type (noncommutative Poisson structure). All structure maps are given by the integrals over the configuration space of concave polygons and the first two maps are related to the (Shoikhet-Tsygan-)Kontsevich Formality. As with the known formality theorems, we prove the $A_\infty$-relations via Stokes' theorem by constructing a closed form and a configuration space whose boundary components lead to the $A_\infty$-relations. This gives a new way to formulate higher spin gravities and hints at a construct encompassing the known formality theorems.'''
