BBC

With just one day to go, the race for the White House is deadlocked - both at the national level and in the all-important battleground states.

The polls are so close, within the margin of error, that either Donald Trump or Kamala Harris could actually be two or three points better off - enough to win comfortably.

There is a compelling case to make for why each may have the edge when it comes to building a coalition of voters in the right places, and then ensuring they actually turn out.

Let’s start with the history-making possibility that a defeated president might be re-elected for the first time in 130 years.

## Trump could win because…

## 1. He’s not in power

The economy is the number one issue for voters, and while unemployment is low and the stock market is booming, most Americans say they are struggling with higher prices every day.

Inflation hit levels not seen since the 1970s in the aftermath of the pandemic, giving Trump the chance to ask “Are you better off now than you were four years ago?”

In 2024, voters around the world have several times thrown out the party in power, partly due to the high, post-Covid, cost of living. US voters also seem hungry for change.

Only a quarter of Americans say they are satisfied with the direction the country is going in and two-thirds have a poor economic outlook.

Harris has tried to be the so-called change candidate, but as vice-president has struggled to distance herself from an unpopular Joe Biden.

## 2. He seems impervious to bad news

Despite the fallout from the 6 January 2021 riot at the US Capitol, a string of indictments and an unprecedented criminal conviction, Trump’s support has remained stable all year at 40% or above.

While Democrats and “Never-Trump” conservatives say he is unfit for office, most Republicans agree when Trump says he’s the victim of a political witch-hunt.

With both sides so dug in, he just needs to win over enough of the small slice of undecided voters without a fixed view of him.

## 3. His warnings on illegal immigration resonate

Beyond the state of the economy, elections are often decided by an issue with an emotional pull.

Democrats will hope it’s abortion, while Trump is betting it’s immigration.

After encounters at the border hit record levels under Biden, and the influx impacted states far from the border, polls suggest voters trust Trump more on the immigration - and that he’s doing much better with Latinos than in previous elections.

## 4. A lot more people don’t have a degree than do

Trump’s appeal to voters who feel forgotten and left behind has transformed US politics by turning traditional Democratic constituencies like union workers into Republicans and making the protection of American industry by tariffs almost the norm.

If he drives up turnout in rural and suburban parts of swing states this can offset the loss of moderate, college-educated Republicans.

## 5. He’s seen as a strong man in an unstable world

Trump’s detractors say he undermines America’s alliances by cosying up to authoritarian leaders.

The former president sees his unpredictability as a strength, however, and points out that no major wars started when he was in the White House.

Many Americans are angry, for different reasons, with the US sending billions to Ukraine and Israel - and think America is weaker under Biden.

A majority of voters, especially men who Trump has courted through podcasts like Joe Rogan's,

## Harris could win because…

## 1. She’s not Trump

Despite Trump’s advantages, he remains a deeply polarising figure.

In 2020, he won a record number of votes for a Republican candidate, but was defeated because seven million more Americans turned out to support Biden.

This time, Harris is playing up the fear factor about a Trump return. She’s called him a “fascist” and a threat to democracy, while vowing to move on from “drama and conflict”.

Ain July indicated that four in five Americans felt the country was spiralling out of control. Harris will be hoping voters - especially moderate Republicans and independents - see her as a candidate of stability.

## 2. She’s also not Biden

Democrats were facing near-certain defeat at the point Biden dropped out of the race. United in their desire to beat Trump, the party quickly rallied around Harris. With impressive speed from a standing start, she delivered a more forward-looking message that excited the base.

While Republicans have tied her to Biden’s more unpopular policies, Harris has rendered some of their Biden-specific attack lines redundant.

The clearest of these is age - polls consistently suggested voters had real concerns about Biden’s fitness for office. Now the race has flipped, and it is Trump who’s vying to become the oldest person to ever win the White House.

## 3. She's championed women's rights

This is the first presidential election since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade and the constitutional right to an abortion.

Voters concerned about protecting abortion rights overwhelmingly back Harris, and we’ve seen in past elections - notably the 2022 midterms - that the issue can drive turnout and have a real impact on the result.

This time around, 10 states, including the swing state Arizona, will have ballot initiatives asking voters how abortion should be regulated. This could boost turnout in Harris’s favour.

The historic nature of her bid to become the first female president may also strengthen her significant lead among women voters.

## 4. Her voters are more likely to show up

The groups Harris is polling more strongly with, such as the college-educated and older people, are more likely to vote.

Democrats ultimately perform better with high-turnout groups, while Trump has made gains with relatively low-turnout groups such as young men and those without college degrees.

Trump, for example, holds a huge lead among those who were registered but didn’t vote in 2020, according to a New York Times/Siena poll.

A key question, then, is whether they will show up this time.

## 5. She’s raised - and spent - more money

It’s no secret that American elections are expensive, and 2024 is on track to be the most expensive ever.

But when it comes to spending power - Harris is on top. She’s raised more since becoming the candidate in July than Trump has in the entire period since January 2023, according to a recent Financial Times analysis, which also noted that her campaign has spent almost twice as much on advertising.

This could play a role in a razor-tight race that will ultimately be decided by voters in swing states currently being bombarded by political ads.

How does the United States compare with other countries on socioeconomic indicators?

These six graphics provide an overview of the economy, demographics, healthcare, education and military spending as voters get ready to cast their ballots on November 5.
## Largest economy in the world

The US has the largest economy in the world, with a gross domestic product (GDP) of approximately $27 trillion, according to theThis positions it ahead of other major economies, including China ($17.8 trillion) and Germany ($4.5 trillion)

The US has a GDP per capita of $65,020 – roughly four times the global average, placing it seventh in the world.

The US Treasury has the highest gold reserves in the world, at, valued at about $700bn. This amount is more than double that of Germany’s reserves, which stand at 3,352 tonnes, and three times as much as Italy’s 2,452 tonnes.

While GDP reflects a country’s overall economic output, its gold reserves play a distinct role in the financial landscape by supporting monetary policy and influencing currency stability and trade.

## An ageing population

With a population of 335 million, the US is the third most populous country in the world, behind India (1.43 billion) and China (1.41 billion).

However, the population growth rate has been steadily declining, and coupled with an ageing population, presents economic and social challenges, such as maintaining productivity and supporting seniors.

The country’sis just 1.84, indicating that the average woman is expected to have fewer than two children in her lifetime, which is below the global average of 2.4 and the replacement rate of 2.1 needed for a stable population without migration.

The countries with the highest fertility rates are Niger (6.64), Angola (5.70) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (5.49), while Taiwan (1.11), South Korea (1.12) and Singapore (1.17) have the lowest rates.

The averagein the US is 81 years, which is slightly higher than the global average of 75 years, but still lower than that of most European and other developed countries.

## Quality of life

The US federal minimum wage has been $7.25 per hour since 2009.

Raising the minimum wage is a key election issue, with more than 80 percent of US voters believing the current wage is not enough for a decent quality of life, according to, a progressive US think tank.

With an average work week of 37-52 hours, the annual minimum wage in the US is about $15,080. This is about double the global average of $6,293, but only about half of what minimum wage workers make in countries like Australia ($34,515), New Zealand ($33,487) and Luxembourg ($32,103).

However, when it comes to affordability, such as buying a house, the US ranks among the highest in the world with a price-to-income ratio of 131.3. With 2015 as the base year, this means that the average price of a home in the US has outpaced income growth by more than 30 percent.

Both US presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump say they will introduce tax policies to support first-time homebuyers.

## World’s most expensive healthcare

The US has the most expensive healthcare costs in the world, with the country spending more than $12,000 per capita each year.

The high costs for services, medications and insurance premiums create barriers to access, especially for the most vulnerable, leaving many people uninsured or underinsured.

US government healthcare spending is 16.6 percent of the country’s GDP, about seven percent higher than the global average of 7.3 percent.

Despite its relatively high healthcare spending, the US’s Health Index Score is lower than that of many other high-income countries. The Health Index Score measures how healthy people are and their access to healthcare services.

Harris is a strong supporter of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which aims to make health services affordable to more Americans. She has pledged to expand this 14-year-old legislation, but Trump tried to repeal it many times during his 2017-2021 tenure as US president.

## Education rankings

According to the, public education spending in the US falls short of global benchmarks and lags behind economic growth.

The US spends around 6.1 percent of its GDP on education, which is higher than the global average of 4.7 percent.

When it comes to performance in mathematics, science, and reading, the US scored a total of 1,468 points in the 2022 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA).

This score exceeds the global average of 1,320 points, but it falls short compared to several Asian countries, including Singapore, which scored 1,679 points, China at 1,605 points and Japan at 1,599 points.

## Military expenditure and power

The US spends more on its military than the next 10 highest-spending countries combined, accounting for 39 percent of all global military expenditures.

At nearly $900bn, as a share of GDP, US military expenditure is 3.45 percent, well above the global average of 2 percent.

The US is ranked number one out of 145 countries by the Global Firepower Index, which measures a nation’s war capabilities across land, sea and air.

Spanish rescuers are searching inundated garages in Valencia for bodies after devastating floods.

The death toll stands at 217, almost all in the eastern Valencia region, in Spain’s worst such disaster in decades.

National weather service AEMET announced the end of the emergency for Valencia but placed part of the northeastern Catalonia region on the highest red alert for torrential rain on Monday.

Catalan trains were suspended until further notice, Transport Minister Oscar Puente announced on X, while flights were delayed and diverted at Barcelona’s El Prat airport.

Thousands of soldiers, police officers, civil guards and firefighters spent a sixth day distributing aid and clearing mud and debris to find bodies.

But relief works have reached only some towns days after the disaster and in many cases, volunteers were the first to provide food, water, sanitation and cleaning equipment.

“We shouldn’t romanticise it: the people saved the people because we were abandoned,” said Jorge, a resident of the town of Chiva, where the king and queen cancelled their visit on Sunday after crowds in Paiporta hurled mud and insults at the royals.

The applause should be for the volunteers, not “those who come just to take a picture and show off”, the 25-year-old told the AFP news agency.

Divers on Monday concentrated their search for missing bodies in garages and a multistorey car park in the town of Aldaia capable of holding thousands of vehicles.

The storm caught many victims in their vehicles on roads and in underground spaces such as car parks, tunnels and garages where rescue operations are particularly difficult.

Local authorities extended travel restrictions for another two days to facilitate the work of the emergency services, cancelled classes in Valencia and urged citizens to work from home.

Storms coming off the Mediterranean are common for the season. But scientists have warned human-induced climate change is increasing the ferocity, length and frequency of extreme weather events.

“Politicians haven’t acted on climate change, and now we’re paying the consequences of their inaction,” environmental activist Emi, 21, told AFP in Chiva."""
