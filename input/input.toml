The re-election of Donald Trump to the White House is focusing minds in Europe, and with dozens of leaders meeting in Budapest, they have the perfect chance to talk it through.

Trump's first term in office saw a dramatic souring of relations. He was angry European countries didn’t pay more towards their own security.

He was livid about the US trade deficit with Europe. And he seemed particularly irate with EU big power Germany on both those counts. Just ask German ex-Chancellor Angela Merkel.

So what will the future Trump presidency mean for the continent? And in particular, for Ukraine?

Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky is in the Hungarian capital for a meeting of the European Political Community. It was the brainchild of French President Emmanuel Macron - launched following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine as a talking-shop to jointly tackle continental challenges.

The fear here is that the new US administration will slow, if not stop, the flow of American military aid to Kyiv. The US has been the largest single donor to Ukraine. By far. And Europe will struggle to take up the slack.

Trump boasted in the past he could end the war with Russia in a day. What isn’t clear is whether he wants Ukraine to win.

Europe’s leaders, notably UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, have repeatedly pledged to stand by Ukraine.

Zelensky will appeal to them on Thursday to stay true to their word.

Things look challenging for Kyiv, to say the least.

Not only is the future of US military aid now insecure, there’s a question mark too over Ukraine’s second largest donor, Germany. Its three-party coalition government crumbled late on Wednesday.

On top of all this, the host of Thursday’s meeting is none other than Hungary’s Trump-enthusiastic Prime Minister, Viktor Orban. Also well-known for his close ties to Moscow, his reluctance to impose sanctions on Russia and to provide self-defence weapons to Ukraine.

He has repeatedly called on the EU to demand an "unconditional and immediate ceasefire" between Ukraine and Russia: going against the insistence among Ukraine’s Western allies to date that Kyiv should dictate its own terms.

Orban describes Trump as being in what he calls his "pro-peace" camp.

All that said, President Zelensky and others in Budapest this Thursday hope to maintain friendly relations with the new Trump administration for as long as possible.

The mainly gushing congratulatory messages from Europe’s leaders on social media made that abundantly clear. But Trump will know that most of them favoured his Democrat rival for the presidency, Kamala Harris.

The US electoral race was always predicted to be tight, and EU officials insist they are better prepared for Trump 2.0 than in 2016, when they were taken by surprise.

But Trump’s isolationism still worries Europe deeply.

The continent looks to the US for security. It has done so since the end of World War Two. It seeks protection from Russian expansionism and help in defending Ukraine. Problem is: Trump is no fan (and that’s putting it politely) of Nato, the transatlantic military alliance.

Trade is another concern, especially for the EU.

The US is its biggest trade partner. But Trump is protectionist. He loves slapping tariffs on imports, he says.

This is bad news for Europe’s already sluggish economies. Like export-reliant Germany, with its ailing automobile industry. The European Commission says it’s ready, if needs be, with retaliatory measures, but would rather avoid marching down the trade war path with Trump.

Unity is another niggle. Trump, with his America First policy, not unlike Russia's Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping of China, who push their own nationalist agendas on the world stage, would prefer not to face off against a strong, united Europe. Divide and rule is their preference.

Viktor Orban is not the only huge Trump fan here. So is Slovakia’s prime minister, and, to an extent, Italy’s premier too. They lean towards Trump in a way that divides them from most of the rest.

Brussels frets about other EU member states now potentially rushing to secure good bilateral relations with Trump at the expense of unity. Leaving the bloc weaker.

But an EU diplomat I spoke to, who asked not to be named in order to speak freely, believes the opposite could also be true.

“We in Brusselsabout Brexit at the time,” he told me.

“We thought other member states would follow the UK out the EU door. But the reverse happened. EU countries melded together more through the Brexit process. Donald Trump might have the same effect on us. Drive us closer together. Force us to be more self-reliant.”

Just before US election day, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, himself a former big figure in Brussels proclaimed on X: “The future of Europe no longer depends on presidential elections in the US, but primarily on Europe itself.”

Maybe. Or maybe not.

Another, rather scared school of thought amongst traditional politicians in Europe is that this victory for Trump could prove a boost for right-wing nationalists far closer to home.

European populists who share his belief that they are the true voice of voters: upset about the economy, about immigration, about the state of their respective countries and demanding change now.

## Biden pledges ‘peaceful transition’, dodges ironies in US election defeat

*Joe Biden offered Donald Trump congratulations on his election victory, and also tried to console Democrats.*

A smiling US President Joe Biden has pledged to ensure a “peaceful transition of power” on January 20 when former president and now President-elect Donald Trump is due to be inaugurated as the country’s 47th head of state.

“I will do my duty as president,” Biden told a crowd of senior officials and staff during a brief seven-minute address on Thursday in the White House’s Rose Garden. “On January 20th, we will have a peaceful transfer of power.”

Offering Trump his congratulations, Biden said “we accept the choice the country made” as he tried to send an upbeat message despite the gloom in his Democratic Party.

Biden said he had also promised a smooth transition in a phone call with Trump on Wednesday, during which he invited the Republican leader to a meeting at the White House.

Biden said he also spoke with Vice President Kamala Harris over the phone on Wednesday to congratulate her on her run for the presidency, despite the loss. “She ran an inspiring campaign,” Biden said on Thursday about Harris. “She has a backbone like a ramrod,” he added.

As Democrats pick up the pieces afteron Tuesday, some in the party have expressed frustration that the 81-year-old Biden did not decide to abandon his bid for re-election until this summer, despite longstanding voter concerns about his age, as well as widespread dissatisfaction with high inflation, the US role in thein Gaza, and migration over the border with Mexico.

“The biggest onus of this loss is on President Biden,” said, who ran against Biden in 2020 for the Democratic nomination and endorsed Harris’s unsuccessful run. “If he had stepped down in January instead of July, we may be in a very different place,” Yang told AP.

US Senator Bernie Sanders, an ally of Biden and Harris, said in a statement thatrevealed that the Democratic Party leadership had lost touch with the concerns of working-class Americans.

“Will the big money interests and well-paid consultants who control the Democratic Party learn any real lessons from this disastrous campaign?” the Vermont independent asked. “Will they understand the pain and political alienation that tens of millions of Americans are experiencing?”

Biden spent much of his speech seeking to reassure his “hurting” supporters not to feel too down.

“You can’t love your country only when you win,” he said, repeating a theme he has referenced in previous speeches. “Setbacks are unavoidable, but giving up is unforgivable … The American experiment endures. We’re going to be OK.”
## Election ironies

Biden’s speech was laced with irony about his accomplishments and his promise to turn over power to his successor, Trump, who when he lost re-election in 2020and did not attend Biden’s inauguration in 2021 after many Democrats say he tried to organise an illegal insurrection to remain in power.

Throughout the campaign, Biden repeatedly framed a possible Trump return to the White House as a, and the two men have repeatedly hurled insults at each other.

Trump has called Biden the “worst president in the history of this country”, and Biden described Trump supporters asonly days before Tuesday’s election, before trying to walk the comment back and say it was a reference to a comedian who spoke ill of Puerto Ricans at a Trump rally.

Now that the election is over, Biden on Thursday urged people on both sides to “bring down the temperature”.

In another irony, Biden told his supporters to take comfort from the policy accomplishments of his four years in office, including his signature massive infrastructure spending bill, much of which will “take time” to have the impact felt.

“We are leaving behind the strongest economy in the world, ” Biden said, ignoring the fact that exit polls show many voters cast their ballots against Democratic candidates because of their view that the current White House had handled the economy poorly, leaving them struggling with high inflation and stagnant wages.

Biden ended his remarks on another ironic note, commending election workers for demonstrating the integrity of the country’s voting system, which Trump and many Republicans have vociferously criticised as being vulnerable to fraud.

“It is honest, it is fair and it is transparent,” he said.

Biden’s address to the nation came a day afterthe race Wednesday afternoon in a speech to tearful supporters gathered at her alma mater, Howard University, where she stressed that while she did not win the presidential election this year, the fight is far from over.

“The outcome of the election is not what we wanted, not what we fought for, not what we voted for,” she said, while saying that, as a matter of principle, her supporters should accept the results.

“Do not despair. This is not a time to throw up our hands. This is a time to roll up our sleeves,” Harris said. “This is a time to organise, to mobilise and to stay engaged for the sake of freedom and justice and the future that we all know we can build together.”

Pro-Israeli policies featured heavily in the US president-elect’s previous White House term.

Donald Trump’s win is being celebrated by Israel’s government – but not by Palestinians and others under Israeli attack.

He has promised to bring peace, without saying how.

Last time in office, Trump was surrounded by hardline Zionists and supporters of Israel and was described by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as the most pro-Israeli US president ever.

Trump says he will bring peace to the Middle East, just as he promised last time with his so-called “Deal of the Century” that went nowhere.

But the situation has worsened since then – hugely so for Palestinians, but also in terms of regional tensions.

So what could Trump’s return to the White House mean for Israel, Palestinians and the wider Middle East?
