Moment giant explosions seen near Beirut airport

Israeli bombing caused large explosions in Beirut, including one close to the international airport during a further night of air strikes targeting Hezbollah.

The airport borders Dahieh, Hezbollah's stronghold in the capital. Plumes of smoke could be seen over the city on Friday morning.

US outlets citing Israeli officials reported the target was Hashem Safieddine, a cousin of Hezbollah's former leader Hassan Nasrallah. Safieddine has been widely regarded as the most likely candidate to replace Nasrallah after his death in an Israeli strike last week.

Lebanon's public health ministry said 37 people had been killed in ground and air attacks in the last 24 hours while 151 others had been wounded.

Elsewhere, the Lebanese army said two of its soldiers had been killed in the country's south as Israeli forces pressed on with their invasion against Hezbollah and ordered another 20 towns and villages to evacuate.

The Israeli military has not commented, but did say its troops had killed Hezbollah fighters near the border. Hezbollah said it had targeted Israeli troops on both sides of the frontier.

The two fatal attacks on the Lebanese army soldiers were just hours apart on Thursday, the third full day of the invasion.

In the first incident, the army said, one soldier was killed and another was wounded “as a result of an aggression by the Israeli enemy during an evacuation and rescue operation with the Lebanese Red Cross in Taybeh village".

The Red Cross said four of its volunteers were also lightly wounded, and that their movements had been co-ordinated with UN peacekeepers.

The army said that in the second incident another soldier was killed “after the Israeli enemy targeted an army post in the Bint Jbeil area”.

“The personnel at the post responded to the sources of fire,” the Lebanese army added, marking a rare involvement in a conflict in which it has not engaged.

The news came as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told residents of another two dozen towns and villages in the south, including the regional capital of Nabatieh, to leave immediately for their own safety.

Unlike the communities ordered to evacuate on Tuesday, they are all located north of the Litani river, which lies about 30km (18 miles) from the border.

Before the invasion, Israel had demanded that Hezbollah’s withdraw to the Litani, in accordance with a UN Security Council resolution that ended their last war in 2006.

Speaking to the BBC from Beirut, the World Food Programme's country director in Lebanon, Matthew Hollingworth, described the situation there as “horrific”.

“There is black smoke billowing over the southern suburbs and we see it each morning when we come to work and we see it all day long. And there's a striking number of people who are displaced around the city.”

“There are these cars everywhere that are from people that have fled the fighting in the south of the country and the southern suburbs. There's traffic everywhere, people sleeping outside.”

Juan Gabriel Wells, Lebanon country director with the International Rescue Committee, said nearly half of displaced people surveyed by his organisation in shelters run by the government were children under the age of 15.

Israel's latest air strikes on Beirut come 24 hours after a residential building in the centre of the capital was hit. A civil defence agency linked to Hezbollah also said seven of its first responders were among nine people killed in the strike.

Lebanon’s health minister later said more than 40 paramedics and firefighters had been killed by Israeli fire in the past three days.

The Israeli Air Force carried out air strikes during Thursday against targets it said belonged to Hezbollah including the group's intelligence headquarters, weapons production sites, weapons storage facilities.

Two weeks of Israeli strikes and other attacks targeting Hezbollah have killed more than 1,300 people across Lebanon and displaced more than one million, according to local authorities.

Israel went on the offensive after almost a year of cross-border hostilities sparked by the war in Gaza, saying it wanted to ensure the safe return of residents of border areas displaced by Hezbollah rocket, missile and drone attacks.

Hezbollah is a Shia Islamist military, political and social organisation that wields considerable power in Lebanon. It is designated as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, the UK and other countries.

The IDF also announced on Thursday that its aircraft had struck 200 Hezbollah “terrorist targets” in southern Lebanon and elsewhere overnight, including weapons storage facilities and observation posts. About 15 Hezbollah fighters were killed when the municipality building in Bint Jbeil was hit, it said.

Later, it said a structure housing three Hezbollah commanders had been destroyed during a joint operation carried out by the air force and infantry.

Hezbollah said on Thursday evening that its fighters had “repelled failed attempts” by Israeli commandos to advance into some border villages during the day.

The group also said it had targeted “enemy gatherings” and homes on the other side of the frontier, while also continuing to fire rockets deep into northern Israel.

The IDF said more than 230 projectiles had been launched into Israeli territory over the course of the day. Most were intercepted or fell in open areas, and there were no casualty reports.

The communities sitting along Israel’s northern border fence are now a closed military zone.

Dean Sweetland said his house near Israel's northern border shook several times a day with rocket and anti-tank missiles fired from Lebanon

Dean Sweetland, a former British soldier who moved to Israel eight years ago, is one of the few people still living in a near-empty kibbutz within sight of the Lebanese town of Bint Jbeil.

He told the BBC that his house shook several times a day with rocket and anti-tank missiles fired from Lebanon, some of them intercepted by Israel’s air-defences overhead.

“We can’t continue this for another year, having Hezbollah sitting on our border just waiting to do an October 7th on us,” he said, referring to Hamas’s deadly attack on southern Israel last year that triggered the Gaza war.

“But my son is in the army, and do we want our kids to be in there, slaughtered, where Hezbollah has been waiting for us to go in for nearly 20 years?”

“It’s not going to be pretty,” he continued, “but if that’s what it takes, then that’s what it takes.”

## Six hours at hands of Hamas - new accounts reveal how Israeli base fell on 7 October

BBC

One year on from the 7 October Hamas attacks, tough questions are still being asked within Israel about the deadliest day in its history, when the country's powerful army was caught off guard and swiftly overwhelmed.

The BBC has heard accounts given to families of what happened at one military base that guarded the border with Gaza.

The Nahal Oz base was overrun by Hamas gunmen on the morning of 7 October and more than 60 Israeli soldiers are reported to have been killed - with others taken hostage.

Israel’s military is yet to publish its official inquiry into what happened there that day, but it has already briefed relatives of those killed there, and some have shared those details with the BBC.

This is the closest we have to an official account by Israel’s military of what happened on the day.

In an attempt to further piece together events, we have also spoken to survivors, seen messages from those who died, and listened to voice recordings reporting the attack as it happened, helping to build a picture of the speed and ferocity of the invasion.

The BBC has found:

* Suspicious activity was spotted by many soldiers at the base before 7 October, not just the young women whose job it was to monitor border cameras
* Soldiers noticed an abrupt stop to Hamas activity in the days before the attack
* Many Israeli troops there were unarmed and official protocols had soldiers standing back when under attack, instead of advancing
* Some surveillance equipment was either out of action or able to be destroyed by Hamas with ease

The details we have established raise questions - including why so few soldiers were armed at a base so close to the border, why more wasn’t done to respond to the intelligence and warnings that had been received, how it took so long for reinforcements to arrive, and whether the very infrastructure of the base had left those there unprotected.

We put our findings to the IDF, who responded to say it was in the midst of a “thorough investigation into the events of October 7th, including those in Nahal Oz, and the circumstances preceding”.

\_\_\_

On 7 October, Sharon - not her real name - began her shift at Nahal Oz, about a kilometre from the Gaza border fence, at**04:00**.

She was part of the base’s all-women military unit - known as Tatzpitaniyot in Hebrew - and their role was to study live surveillance footage captured by cameras along the fence.

The women worked in shifts in the base’s war room, or Hamal, watching Gaza through a bank of monitors around the clock.

The Hamal is a windowless room protected by a solid door and blast walls, with strict security protocols.

The IDF has told families of people on the base that day that many military staff were unarmed.

Gen Israel Ziv, former head of the IDF's Operations Division, told the BBC that during his service, there would never have been unarmed soldiers in border areas.

“It doesn’t make sense… The soldier is about the weapon,” he says.

The armed staff at Nahal Oz that day included a unit of infantry soldiers from the IDF’s Golani brigade.

The BBC has previously reported that the Tatzpitaniyot had noticed, but we have now established that these concerns were also shared by other soldiers at the base from different units.

In the days shortly before 7 October, however, things had gone quiet.

“There was nothing and that was frightening us,” one infantry soldier stationed at the base recalls.“Everybody felt that something was strange. It didn’t make sense.”

The IDF's failure to grasp what was happening was down to “a lot of arrogance”, says Gen Ziv, the thought that “Hamas wouldn’t attack, wouldn’t dare, and that even if so, they are not capable”.

“We went to sleep on the 6th thinking there’s a cat over there and we woke up on the 7th and there’s a tiger.”

At**05:30**, members of the Golani prepared to begin a jeep patrol along the Israeli side of the fence - something they did before dawn every morning. But they were then instructed by their superiors to delay the patrol and stand back because of a threat of anti-tank missiles, three of them have told the BBC.

“There was a warning. It was forbidden to go up the route next to the fence,” one recalls.

Another Golani, 21-year-old Shimon Malka, said such a warning was unusual but not unheard of, so they gave it little thought.

IDF infantry soldier Shimon Malka: “For us, it was just another day. I remember at 6 o’clock saying we’ll go back to sleep because it’s Saturday.”

Gen Ziv says it is standard IDF protocol to stand people back during suspected attacks like this so they can “avoid being exposed as a target”. But, he says, “Hamas realised that and used it” to their advantage.

He said the base should have been equipped with positions that the Golani could safely respond from.

“There are very simple techniques to cover soldiers so they’re under cover but they’re still in a position to react, to not lose sight,” he said.

As the Golani waited away from the fence, Sharon began seeing movements among Hamas fighters. But they seemed nothing other than routine - “they also have shifts.”

By**06:20**Hamas had begun shooting rockets, but again Sharon says this did not seem immediately alarming - she had experienced rocket attacks before and the base was well-shielded against them.

“It’s usually five minutes of shooting and then a break,” she says.

But this time, there was no break.

At about**06:30**, Sharon says she could see Hamas forces beginning to close in.

The Tatzpitaniyot radioed through to the ground forces to alert them.

“All stations, four people running to the fence, copy,” one of the young women announced, her voice shaking slightly. "I am identifying two armed people running to the fence, copy.”

Listen to Roni Eshel's radio message: "I am identifying two armed people running to the fence." Roni later died in the 7 October attacks

About the same time, Shimon heard the code words for a rocket attack through his radio. His commander ordered they jump from their jeep into a Namer - a type of Israeli armoured personnel carrier - and head towards the fence.

But he couldn’t see any incursions and assumed it was just a drill.

This so-called iron wall had long been viewed by the IDF and people across Israel as impenetrable, and yet bases along it began reporting breaches.

Each of the Tatzpitaniyot on shift at Nahal Oz witnessed between two and five breaches of the section of border fence they were responsible for monitoring, says Sharon. They watched as Hamas fighters made their way inside Israel.

Gen Ziv says the ease with which fighters had crossed the fence showed the flaws in a barrier perceived to be impenetrable.

“As you saw, two truck-loads could come and push it. It was nothing. Even if there was a minefield of 50 or 60 metres over there, it would have delayed Hamas for a few hours.”

Shortly before**06:40**, an observation post at Nahal Oz was hit and damaged by a rocket, according to IDF family briefing notes shared with the BBC.

A sniper-sighting system was put into action from the Hamal - the nerve centre of the base - and an officer attempted to shoot remotely at gunmen trying to cross the border, the IDF told families.

Infantry officers joined the Tatzpitaniyot in the Hamal, too. Sharon remembers one commander arriving in her pyjamas.

And then, as gunmen continued to shoot at surveillance cameras, the monitoring screens in the Hamal started to go dark.

The fact that Hamas had been operating in plain sight of these surveillance cameras, along the border in the weeks before, was tactical, says Gen Ziv, in order to “normalise things”.

Just 100 metres from where the Tatzpitaniyot were working, Alroy - one of the five IDF observation balloonists on site that morning - was woken by the rockets and the sirens, his father Rafi Ben Shitrit told the BBC.

The IDF later provided details of an initial investigation to Alroy’s family about what happened that day.

The balloon at Nahal Oz offered a deeper view into Gaza, and was supposed to be operational 24 hours a day.

But on 7 October it was one of three along the border that were out of action.

“The balloon in Nahal Oz didn't work and no-one was stressed, they were told it would be fixed on Sunday,” says Mr Ben Shitrit.

“There was an atmosphere like: ‘Hamas is deterred, even if something happens it's a terrorist infiltration or at most a terrorist squad.’”

Back at her surveillance point, Sharon carried on frantically communicating with soldiers on the ground.

“I cried and announced, simultaneously,” she says.

She remembers that the commanding officer yelled for “quiet” because some of the young women were losing focus amid the horror.

At the fence, Shimon says he followed the radio directions. He still couldn’t understand why the young woman’s voice he was hearing sounded so panicked.

“I could feel the stress, but I couldn’t see anything.”

When his unit reached the place the Tatzpitaniyot had directed them to, they saw Hamas trucks breaking through the fence.

“They started to shoot at us. Maybe five trucks.”

The soldiers shot back and ran over those on motorbikes.

Shortly after**07:00**came the moment everyone feared and nobody could imagine. Hamas gunmen were at the door of the Hamal.

“Get up, the terrorists are at the door,” Sharon remembers being told.

The Tatzpitaniyot were ordered to abandon their positions and head to an office inside the war room.

Gen Ziv says that those higher up in the military did not put enough emphasis on defending the bases themselves, focusing instead on external patrols.

“That was part of the whole mess because once the enemy surprised them and went into the base they were not ready. The whole thing collapsed,” he says.

At about**07:20**what was known as the shield - a bomb shelter outside the Hamal - was attacked.

Among those sheltering inside were some off-duty Tatzpitaniyot, who were being protected by “four female warriors”, according to a WhatsApp message sent at**07:38**by one of the Tatzpitaniyot sheltering there and seen by the BBC.

There were no further messages from her in the group.

The IDF told families that these “female warriors” were the only armed people hiding in the shelter - and they kept Hamas fighters at bay with their gunfire until a grenade explosion killed one of the commanders and injured others inside.

At this point, about 10 of the soldiers managed to escape the shelter and locked themselves in the accommodation barracks. Everyone else in the shield was either killed or captured by Hamas.

Shimon and his commander headed back to the base, but they still weren’t aware of the scale of what was happening.

The IDF would later brief the family of one of those killed at Nahal Oz that the attack on the base was begun by drone strikes, and action by 70 fighters from four directions, and that scores more joined as the morning went on.

Hamas drone strike targets vehicles inside the base.

Up and down the Gaza Strip, thousands crossed into Israeli territory.

On his way back to base Shimon says he began to comprehend the scale of the attack.

“When we got to the base, everything was burned,” he says.

In the office inside the Hamal, Sharon says the group of about 20 soldiers tried to calm each other down.

Meanwhile, they made repeated attempts to call for more support.

“I guess [someone] said something like ‘There’s no backup, no-one can come,’ and I remember my officer said ‘We don’t need backup, we need rescue.’”

Shortly before**08:00**an Israeli drone, known as a Zik, arrived, but it had difficulty distinguishing between Israeli soldiers and Hamas, according to the IDF account, which meant it was slower to attack its intended targets.

At about the same time, an attack began on the Hamal, with lots of shooting. Those armed fought at the doors of the building to prevent Hamas from getting inside. The fighting continued for about four hours.

Meanwhile, Shimon says he and other soldiers fighting at the base were completely outnumbered. There was no sign of reinforcements.

“It was all vague.”

At about**09:00**, the Golani headed to the base’s dining room where the Tatzpitaniyot had told them most of the gunmen were hiding.

Relatives would later be told by the IDF that there were 150 gunmen to every 25 combat soldiers entering Nahal Oz that day.

“What Hamas was doing that morning was swarming,” says Gen Ziv.

“There were over 70 different breaches… over 3,000 terrorists… They knew they didn’t have the quality so they had to go quantity.”

A video, which Israeli media reports was filmed around this time, shows young surveillance officers at Nahal Oz, who had been captured by armed Hamas.

“You dogs, we will step on you,” one man is heard saying as the women’s hands are tied, their faces against the wall.

Dr Ayelet Levy's daughter Naama was taken hostage from Nahal Oz by Hamas. "My daughter is a very strong girl," she says

Nineteen-year-old Naama Levy, who had only started at the base the previous day, pleads that she has “friends in Palestine”, her face covered in blood.

The footage shows the women being dragged into a waiting vehicle and driven away.

It is devastating for Naama’s mother to watch. “The wounds, the blood, what she was saying, what the terrorists were saying to them, the horror of those moments,” says Dr Ayelet Levy.

Gen Ziv says the Tatzpitaniyot at Nahal Oz “were amazing - the mistake was the system, the commanders, not them”.

More than three hours after the attack had begun, at**09:45**, an IDF helicopter started firing at the Hamas gunmen, officers told grieving relatives. It fired into the base 12 times.

Shimon and six others, including their commander, drove out of the base and returned in formation on foot. He says they were fired on “from all directions”.

Through the sound of automatic gunfire would come a series of single shots, fired by a Hamas sniper they couldn’t see.

“Every time he shot, one of my friends got a bullet in the head,” he says.

Shimon says he was the only one of those fighting alongside him to survive, and he too, had a near miss.

“A bullet passed right by my head… I could hear the bullets hitting the concrete around me and feel the heat from them.”

At this point, he says his radio was no longer operational.

Gen Ziv describes the day as a “perfect storm”.

“For so many hours the backup was not there because nobody knew exactly what was going on and where to send the backup,” he explains.

Shimon escaped the scene and moved to a sniper's position before joining with soldiers from another unit who went to protect a kibbutz.

Back in the Hamal, or war room, there was a significant development at about**11:00**.

The electricity was cut which meant the locks to the doors, which were on an electric system, were released. It left the war room wide open, according to the IDF account given to several families. Hamas fighters began shooting inside and throwing grenades.

One was killed in a face-to-face knife fight with a Golani soldier, the IDF told families.

Gen Ziv said at the point that soldiers were relying on door locks for their safety, the broader military system had “already failed”.

In the IDF’s briefing to families it said “terrorists threw a flammable substance into the Hamal and set it on fire”.

“The smoke was really thick. Everyone started to cough and suffocate. People start to fall and faint,” recalls Sharon.

One mother says she was told by the IDF thatin the attack, though others were not aware of this detail or said the IDF had since changed its account on this.

At about**12:30**, seven people in the Hamal - including Sharon - managed to feel their way to the toilet window and climb out, according to accounts of those there that day.

There, she and the other survivors waited for more to follow. But no-one came. Sharon was the only survivor among the Tatzpitaniyot on shift that day. One other young woman in the unit, who was at the base but not working that morning, also survived.

By the end of 7 October, the military had regained control, but many of those stationed there did not survive the day. Seven Tatzpitaniyot were taken back to Gaza as hostages, where one was killed, another rescued and five still remain.

Across Israel that day, about 1,200 people - including more than 300 soldiers - were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. Since then, more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed as a result of Israeli military action in Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry says.

The Nahal Oz dead were to include Alroy the balloonist and four comrades, who had engaged in a lengthy battle with Hamas, says his father, citing information given to him by the IDF.

They managed to kill close to 10 gunmen, he said, but the five were outnumbered and were all found dead inside a mobile shelter at**14:30**.

The war room - which had been designed as a safe space for the base’s units - was destroyed. Photos and videos show it charred, the screens the Tatzpitaniyot had been carefully monitoring, blackened. Bone fragments were found among the ashes there.

The survivors and the families of those killed and kidnapped are left with unanswered questions about how it went so wrong.

The European Union on Friday voted to adopt definitive tariffs on China-made battery electric vehicles (BEVs).

"Today, the European Commission's proposal to impose definitive countervailing duties on imports of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) from China has obtained the necessary support from EU Member States for the adoption of tariffs," the EU said in a statement.

that it would slap higher tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle imports in June, on the grounds that they benefited "heavily from unfair subsidies" and posed a "threat of economic injury" to electric vehicle producers in Europe.

Duties were also disclosed for individual companies, depending on the extent of their cooperation with the probe. Provisional duties were put in place from early July, but were revised in September based on "substantiated comments on the provisional measures" from interested parties.

In aout Friday, the China Chamber of Commerce to the EU expressed "deep disappointment with this voting outcome," adding that it is "strongly dissatisfied with the EU's adoption of protectionist trade measures."

The chamber also called on the EU to be "cautious" about final measures, to delay their implementation and to focus on finding solutions through negotiations. The EU had said Friday it was still looking for other solutions, even as the tariffs are adopted.

The Chinese Chamber of Commerce to the EU further reiterated its stance that the the bloc's probe into Chinese EVs was "politically motivated and unjustified protectionist measure," saying that higher duties would impact Chinese companies as well as international businesses producing EVs in China.

## Industry response

German automakers criticized the EU's decision.

Mercedes Benz called the tariffs a "mistake" and urged the European Commission to delay their implementation, while BMW said the move marked a "fatal sign" for Europe's auto industry, Reuters reported.

Crisis-stricken Volkswagen meanwhile said that that duties were "the wrong approach and would not improve the competitiveness of the European automotive industry."

The carmakers urged the EU Commission and Chinese government to continue talks, saying that the aim should be to "prevent any countervailing duties and thus a trade conflict." An alternative, negotiated solution was still possible until the tariffs are implemented later this month, Volkswagen said.

Swedish auto maker Volvo Cars, which is owned by China's Geely Holdings, said that it would "continue with our long-held strategy of building our cars where we sell them and have committed significant long-term investment into Europe," according to a statement.

French-Italian conglomerate Stellantis meanwhile said the industry was facing pressure from plans to reduce C02 emissions and from Chinese competition, noting that, at this time "policies supporting the demand and ensuring stability of the rules are more important than ever."

Autos stocks in Europe were last 1.42% higher at 12:19 p.m. London time.

## Division in the EU

The decision follows months of debates and deliberations between EU members, which have expressed varying opinions on increasing tariffs.

While France has supported the measure after previously pushing the EU to start negotiations, Germany has advocated against the step, raising concerns about the consequences for its.

Potential retaliation from China has been a key concern for some EU members, especially as China has already launched anti-dumping probes into pork and brandy exports from the EU, as well as an anti-subsidy investigation into EU dairy products.

German Finance Minister Christian Lindner on Friday urged the European Commission not to start a trade war.

"Despite the vote for potential punitive tariffs against China, Ursula von der Leyen's EU Commission should not trigger a trade war. We need a negotiated solution," he said in aon social media platform X according to a CNBC translation.

The U.S. economy added far more jobs than expected in September, pointing to a vital employment picture as the unemployment rate edged lower, the Labor Department reported Friday.

Nonfarm payrolls surged by 254,000 for the month, up from a revised 159,000 in August and better than the 150,000 Dow Jones consensus forecast. The unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, down 0.1 percentage point.

With upward revisions from previous months, the report eases concerns about the state of the labor market and likely locks in the Federal Reserve to a more gradual pace of interest rate reductions. August's total was revised up by 17,000 while July saw a much larger addition of 55,000, taking the monthly growth up to 144,000.

Strength in job creation spilled over to wages, as average hourly earnings increased 0.4% on the month and were up 4% from a year ago. Both figures were ahead of respective estimates for gains of 0.3% and 3.8%. The average work week nudged lower to 34.2 hours, down 0.1 hour.

"It was 'wow' across the board, much stronger than expected," Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab, said of the report. "The bottom line is it was a very good report. You get upward revisions and it tells you the job market continues to be healthy, and that means the economy is healthy."

Stock market futures added to gains following the report while Treasury yields moved sharply higher.

Restaurants and bars led job creation for the month, with the hospitality industry adding 69,000 positions in September after averaging just 14,000 over the previous 12 months.

Health care, a consistent leader in job growth, contributed 45,000, while government grew by 31,000. Other gainers included social assistance (27,000) and construction (25,000).

A more encompassing measure of unemployment that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons dropped to 7.7%. The share of the workforce either working or looking for work, known as the labor force participation rate, held steady at 62.7%.

The survey of household employment, which is used to calculate the unemployment rate, showed an even stronger picture, with a gain of 430,000 as the employment-to-population ratio increasing to 60.2%, an increase of 0.2 percentage point.

Job creation tilted strongly to full-time positions, which were up 414,000, while those reporting part-time work fell by 95,000.

Futures market pricing shifted sharply after the report, with traders now assigning a strong chance of consecutive quarter percentage point interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve in November and December.

The report comes with questions over the labor market's strength and how that will impact the Fed's approach to lowering interest rates.

Earlier this week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell characterized the jobs picture as "solid" but said it has "clearly cooled" over the past year.

There have been scant signs of a stepped-up pace of layoffs, as new claims for unemployment benefits have held steady but hiring rates have cooled. Business surveys, including the Fed's own "Beige Book" summary of business conditions, indicate that companies are holding head counts fairly steady.

Powell and other Fed officials have indicated a willingness to continue lowering interest rates following last month's half percentage point cut in the overnight borrowing level. However, there's considerable debate within the market about how quickly the central bank will move, and Powell said Monday he expects the Fed to move in quarter-point increments at least through the end of the year.

Several people have died in floods in Bosnia and Herzegovina and others are missing as torrential rain and landslides destroyed homes, roads and bridges across the centre of the country.

The municipality of Jablanica, about 70km (43 miles) southwest of the capital, Sarajevo, which bore the brunt of 24 hours of downpours, was completely cut off on Friday after road and railway links were destroyed.

“At least 14 dead were found in the Jablanica area,” said Darko Jukan, a spokesman for Bosnia’s interethnic presidency, a Bosniak, Serb and Croat tripartite. “There are a lot of people reported missing.”

The civil defence of the Bosniak-Croat Federation said the death toll could rise.

Some houses had been reduced to rubble by landslides, in what appeared to be Bosnia’s worst flooding since at least 2014, when more than 20 people died in floods.

Drone footage broadcast on Bosnian media showed villages and towns completely submerged under water, while videos on social networks showed dramatic scenes of muddy torrents and damaged roads.

The town of Kiseljak, in central Bosnia, was inundated after a river burst its banks. Brown water lapped at the doors of businesses and homes, drone footage taken by the Reuters news agency showed, although the waters had begun to recede on Friday afternoon.

The cantonal government requested military help for the wider Jablanica area, and engineers, rescue units and a helicopter were deployed, including to rescue 17 people from a mental health hospital.

Several people injured were evacuated with a helicopter from the European Union peacekeeping force (EUFOR).

Al Jazeera’s correspondent Ivan Pavkovic, reporting from Grabovica, one of the affected areas near Jablanica, said floods washed away part of the main road, leaving ambulances and police cars stranded.

“They are unable to proceed any further, and traffic is entirely halted, making it impossible to access the area between Jablanica and southern Bosnia,” he said. “Ambulances are now hoping to transfer people by boat.”

Neighbouring Croatia was also hit by floods on Friday, though there were no reports of casualties. Authorities issued a severe weather warning for the Adriatic coast and central regions of the country.

Montenegro and Serbia also issued similar warnings. Floods caused by torrential rains were also reported in Montenegro, south of Bosnia, where some villages were cut off and roads and homes flooded.
