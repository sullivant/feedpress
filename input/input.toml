Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky has told the United Nations that Russia is planning deeper attacks on his country's nuclear power plants, warning of possible "nuclear disaster".

He said he had received intelligence showing Moscow was using satellites provided by other countries to gather information about Ukraine's nuclear infrastructure.

"Radiation does not respect state borders and many nations could feel a devastating effect,” he warned the UN General Assembly on Wednesday.

Russia has repeatedly targeted energy facilities across Ukraine since the start of its full-scale invasion in February 2022.

"Any critical incident in the energy system could lead to a nuclear disaster - a day like that must never come," Zelensky said.

"Moscow needs to understand this, and this depends in part on your determination to put pressure on the aggressor.

"These are nuclear power plants. They must be safe."

The UN nuclear watchdog warned last month that safety at the Zaporizhzhia power plant in Russian-occupied Ukraine was deteriorating.

It followed a strike near the site's perimeter, close to essential water sprinkler ponds and about 100m from the only remaining high-voltage line.

The plant was seized by Russian forces early in the war and has come under repeated attacks, which both sides have blamed the other for.

Zelensky said in his speech on Wednesday that Russia had destroyed all of Ukraine’s thermal power plants and a large part of its hydroelectric capacity as a way to “torment” Ukrainians ahead of winter.

"Energy must stop being used as a weapon," he said.

A major power plant near Kyiv was completely destroyed by Russian strikes in April, and.

While in the United States, Zelensky says he plans to meet President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee.

An official on Donald Trump's campaign said the Republican nominee would not meet the Ukrainian leader - despite statements from officials in Kyiv last week saying Zelensky was planning to see the former president.

Trump described Zelensky as the "greatest salesman on Earth" following his speech and claimed the US would be "stuck in that war" unless he was elected in November.

Also in his UN speech, Zelensky criticised China and Brazil for pushing for talks with Russia, questioning their motivations.

He made a renewed appeal for countries to back his proposals for a full and just peace, reiterating his position that Russian forces needed to withdraw from Ukraine's internationally-recognised borders to bring an end to the war.

Ukraine would not accept a return to a "brutal, colonial past", he added.

announced the Quest 3S, the latest virtual reality headset to come out of the company's Reality Labs division and a cheaper offering than its predecessor.

The device will go on sale on Oct. 15 and will retail starting at $299, down from the $499 starting price for 2023's Quest 3. The device can be used to watch movies, as well as run VR fitness apps and gaming, Meta said Wednesday at its Connect event at its headquarters in Menlo Park, California. The company positioned the headset as a multitasking computer, putting it in competition with Apple's $3,499 Vision Pro headset that launched in February.

In addition to the Quest 3S, Meta on Wednesday also showcased its latest prototype of augmented-reality smart glasses and announced a flurry of new features for its Meta AI chatbot.

Meta's previous Quest devices are the bestselling VR headsets, withthanks to heavy marketing and a lower price than many competitors, but those efforts have yet to spark a cultural phenomenon or a mainstream software ecosystem around VR. Including its acquisition of Oculus in 2014, Meta has poured more than $65 billion in expenses into its hardware efforts.

Meta CEOhas defended the company's spending as a strategic initiative to preventfrom controlling future hardware platforms.

Although there was hope among VR developers that Apple's entry into the market would spur a wave of new apps and users, Apple hasn't revealed sales for its headset and reports say that sales have been in, under 1 million units, partially due to its high price.

## What it does

A Meta representative said the "S" in Quest 3S stands for "start" — as in getting started with VR.

Many of the new Meta features that the company discussed for the $299 Quest 3S have counterparts on Apple's Vision Pro, including a mode that allows for the device to be used on an airplane and another that simulates a large movie theater inside the headset.

Meta highlighted improved "passthrough," the term used to described when a VR headset uses cameras and sensors on the outside of the device to display live real-time video inside the headset. That function is intended to make users feel like they are looking through a display and allows them to interact with the real world while keeping the headset on. For the Quest 3S, Meta added a dedicated button to turn on passthrough.

The company has emphasized the ability of the Quest 3S to multitask and run apps, positioning it as a computing device, instead of a game console.

"All the things you can do with a general purpose computer, Quest is the full package," Zuckerberg said.

In demos provided Tuesday, Meta showcased the device running as many as four apps at one time on floating screens inside the headset, including a YouTube video, a browser, Amazon Music and Meta's app store. Meta says the headset can handle six windows. But the demo experience was not smooth. The Amazon Music app crashed, window controls would disappear and Meta's controllers would fall asleep after a few minutes if the user wasn't pressing buttons.

Besides the Quest 3S, Meta also announced a price cut for last's year Quest 3, bringing the price of the 512GB version down from $650 to $500. The Quest 3 has more advanced lenses and a superior screen with a higher resolution than the Quest 3S.

Additionally, Meta said it will discontinue the Quest Pro, its $999 headset launched in 2022 that never gained much momentum.

## Eventually, glasses

Meta Orion AR glasses prototype

Meta

Zuckerberg's justification for spending so much on VR and AR is his belief that the technology will eventually end up in lightweight, transparent glasses that overlay computer graphics and information onto the real world.

Investing in VR software and hardware are early steps toward those glasses, which could take as much as a decade to develop, Zuckerberg has previously said.

Zuckerberg showed off an early concept of what those glasses could look like on Wednesday. The thick, black-framed prototype, called Orion, won't be sold to consumers, but Meta says they will be used internally as the company continues working toward the consumer glasses it hopes to one day sell.

"This is where we are going," Zuckerberg said.

Meta hopes the next version of Orion will be available to consumers as the company's first full AR glasses, Zuckerberg said without giving a timetable for when that may be.

Zuckerberg said the device revealed on Wednesday was Meta's first "fully-functioning" prototype of the glasses, and would be physically tethered to a small "puck." Zuckerberg also said that it would take advantage of a wrist-based interface, which came out of stems from the company's 2019.

Zuckerberg said that Orion enables users to play games, multi-task with multiple windows. and videoconference with people around the world represented by a realistic avatar.

Meta's Orion prototype comes a week after. Those thick-framed glasses will only be made available to developers, who must commit to paying $99 a month for one full year if they want to build AR apps for the device.

This isn't the first time Meta publicly revealed a prototype of a future devices or research projects to signal to investors and employees where VR and AR technology is headed. The Orion glasses are an improvement on Project Nazare, prototype smart glasses that Zuckerberg, when the company changed its name from Facebook.

Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses are powered by a Qualcomm chip. Qualcomm, Samsung and Google are working on smart glasses, according to Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon.

Meta does sell a pair of glasses with a built-in camera in partnership with EssilorLuxottica called Ray-Ban Meta, which start at $299. While these glasses don't have any displays, they do have tiny speakers that allow the device to play music or interact with Meta AI, the company's voice assistant.

As part of Wednesday's event, Meta announced new Meta AI features for its Ray-Ban smart glasses.

For example, the Ray-Ban Meta glasses will be able to detect when a user is looking at a sign in Spanish and, if asked, can translate in the user's ear, a new improvement, Meta said. The camera can scan QR codes, and it can also extract information like book titles out of photos it takes.

Another new capability for the glasses is the ability to remember facts like where the user parked.

Li-Chen Miller, the vice president of product in charge of Ray-Ban Meta glasses, told CNBC that when she travels, she uses the glasses to take photos of her hotel room door, and later, she asks Meta AI to recall the number.

Zuckerberg is excited about the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, which have sold more than 730,000 units in their first three quarters, according to market researcher IDC. In July, he told investors that they were "a bigger hit sooner than expected."

Last week, EssilorLuxottica and Meta announced that they had extended their partnership to develop more smart glasses.

## AI that speaks

Zuckerberg also introduced improvements to its Meta AI chatbot that will allow people to interact with it using their voice instead of written text.

Users will now be able to have natural voice conversations with Meta AI, which is accessed through Meta apps like Messenger and Instagram. Users will be able to perform actions using their voice, such as telling Meta AI to take a photo by talking to their smartphone.

For Meta AI's new feature, the company is using computer-generated voices from celebrities including Awkwafina, Judi Dench, John Cena, Keegan-Michael Key and Kristen Bell.

The new Siri-like Meta AI voice feature will be available over the next month for U.S., Canadian, Australian and New Zealand users of WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Messenger.

The feature comes one day after rival OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, announcedfor people who pay its premium service.

The company said that the new chatbot features are based on Meta's AI model, Llama. The company also announced a newer version of Llama, called Llama 3.2. This updated model can understand both images and text, an upgrade from its predecessors which generated responses to people's written prompts.

A surge in demand for artificial intelligence-focused semiconductors and AI-enabled smartphones and laptops could lead to the next global chip shortage, according to a report released Wednesday by consultancy Bain & Co.

The last major semiconductor shortage happened during the Covid-19 pandemic amid supply chain disruption and a rise in demand for consumer electronics as people were forced to stay and work at home.

Technology giants have been snapping up graphics processing units, or GPUs, mainly from. These GPUs which are housed in data centers are critical for the training of huge AI models which underpin applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT.

Meanwhile, companies likeare designing chips that go into smartphones and personal computers and allow those devices torather than via an internet connection in the cloud. These are often referred to as AI-enabled devices and companies from Samsung tohave released such products.

Bain said demand for GPUs and AI consumer electronics could be the cause of a chip shortage.

"Surging demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) has caused shortages in specific elements of the semiconductor value chain," Anne Hoecker, head of the technology practice in the Americas at Bain, told CNBC by email.

"If we combine the growth in demand for GPUs alongside a wave of AI-enabled devices, which could accelerate PC product refresh cycles, there could be more widespread constraints on semiconductor supply."

However, it'show much demand such AI-enabled gadgets will have, given what appears to be a cautious approach to them from consumers so far.

Bain noted that the semiconductor supply chain is "incredibly complex, and a demand increase of about 20% or more has a high likelihood of upsetting the equilibrium and causing a chip shortage."

"The AI explosion across the confluence of the large end markets could easily surpass that threshold, creating vulnerable chokepoints throughout the supply chain," the report added.

The semiconductor supply chain is spread across multiple companies. For example, while Nvidia might design its GPUs, they are made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., or, in Taiwan. TSMCfrom countries around the world, such as the Netherlands. Furthermore, the most cutting-edge chips.

Geopolitics could also be a factor prompting a chip shortage. Semiconductors are seen by governments around the world as strategic technology. The U.S. has been on a campaign,, of trying to restrict China's access to the most advanced chips. Meanwhile, Washington has sought to shore up its own domestic capacity to produce semiconductors.

"Geopolitical tensions, trade restrictions, and multinational tech companies' decoupling of their supply chains from China continue to pose serious risks to semiconductor supply. Delays in factory construction, materials shortages, and other unpredictable factors could also create pinch points," Bain said.

*Ukrainian president singles out China, Brazil for pushing what he called ‘half-hearted settlement plans’.*

Ukraine’s president has urged global leaders to stand with his country and not seek “a lull” instead of a “real, just peace” more than two years into Russia’s war.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy delivered the message during anin New York Wednesday, rallying support for histhat demands the expulsion of Russian forces from Ukraine and justice for war crimes.

“Any parallel or alternative attempts to seek peace are, in fact, efforts to achieve a lull instead of an end to the war,” Zelenskyy told the UN body more thanthat has claimed hundreds of thousands of casualties.

Zelenskyy also singled out China and Brazil for pushing what he called “half-hearted settlement plans”, accusing them of playing to their own interests “at Ukraine’s expense”.

On Friday, representatives of 20 UN states are set to discuss a six-point peace planas an alternative to Zelenskyy’s proposal. The plan calls for non-escalation, a boost in humanitarian assistance, efforts to stop nuclear proliferation and an international conference backed by both Russia and Ukraine.
## Fear of nuclear fallout

Zelenskyy’s UN address came as Russian forces claimed further advances in eastern Ukraine, including seizing the settlements of Gostre and Grigorivka in the Donetsk region.

Despite waging ain Russia’s Kursk region in August, Ukraine has continued suffering a series of battlefield losses in the east.

Kyiv now fears intensified Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure, much of which is already battered by the war, could leave it further exposed during the upcoming winter months.

“Since Russia can’t defeat our people’s resistance on the battlefield, Putin is looking for other ways to break the Ukrainian spirit,” Zelenskyy told the UN assembly. “One of his methods is targeting our energy infrastructure.”

The Ukrainian leader specifically warned of potential Russian attacks on the country’s nuclear power plants, saying he had received intelligence alerts of such plans.

“If God forbid, Russia causes a disaster in one of our nuclear power plants, radiation will not respect state borders. And unfortunately, various nations could feel the devastating effects,” Zelenskyy warned.
## White House meeting

Zelenskyy will continue pressing for backing in the war Thursday during a. During the meeting at the White House, Zelenskyy plans to present details of a revamped “victory plan”, which he said includes “quick and concrete steps by our strategic partners”.

The Ukrainian leader is also expected to push for authorisation to use US-supplied ballistic missiles deeper inside Russian territory, a move Washington has feared would escalate the conflict.

Zelenskyy also plans to convene separately with Vice President Kamala Harris, US presidential candidate Donald Trump, and Congress while in Washington.

“Ukraine wants to end this war more than anyone in the world,” said Zelenskyy in his UN address.

Hurricane Helene has rapidly strengthened in the Caribbean Sea while moving north between the coasts of Mexico and Cuba towards the United States, prompting officials to declare an emergency in Florida.

Helene is expected to move overon Wednesday as it moves north across the Gulf of Mexico, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.

Heavy rainfall was forecast for the southeastern US starting Wednesday, with a “life-threatening storm surge” along the entire west coast of Florida, according to the NHC.

On Wednesday afternoon, Helene was located about 135 kilometres (85 miles) from Cozumel, Mexico, and about 810km (503 miles) south-southwest of Tampa, on Florida’s west coast, as it moved northwest at 17km/h (10mph) with maximum sustained winds of 130km/h (80mph).

The strong winds knocked out power in the Cayman Islands where heavy rain and waves reached as high as three metres (10 feet).

Many in Cuba also worried about the storm, whose outer bands are expected to reach the capital of Havana, which is already struggling with chronic power outages.

Mexico is still reeling from former, killing two people, blowing tin roofs off houses, triggering mudslides and toppling trees, officials said.

John weakened to a depression after reaching land but then reformed as a tropical storm on Wednesday, and is forecast to make another landfall in the Mexican state of Guerrero, about 155 km (96 miles) north of Acapulco, on Thursday.
## Forecast to be a ‘major’ hurricane

Helene is expected to grow into a major hurricane — a Category 3 or higher — on Thursday, the day it’s set to reach Apalachee Bay on Florida’s Gulf Coast, according to the official forecast. The NHC has issued hurricane warnings for part of Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula and Florida’s northwestern coastline, where large storm surges of up to 4.5 metres (15 feet) were expected.

“It’s going to be a very large system with impacts across all of Florida,” said Larry Kelly, a hurricane specialist at the NHC.

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis issued an emergency for most of the state’s counties, with Helene expected to pass close to the state capital, Tallahassee where local officials worried about major tree damage.

Federal authorities were positioning generators, food and water, along with search-and-rescue and power restoration teams, the White House said.

The storm is anticipated to be unusually large and fast-moving, meaning storm surges, wind and rain will likely extend several hundred kilometres from the storm’s centre, the NHC added. States as far inland as Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky and Indiana could see rainfall.

Some residents along the Gulf Coast in Florida’s Panhandle, are already evacuating to safer areas inland, with memories still fresh of recent storm surge events.

In 2018,struck Mexico Beach about 160km (100 miles) west of where Helene is expected to make landfall. Michael rapidly intensified into a devastating Category 5 hurricane and caught residents off guard, causing an estimated $25.5bn damage and 59 deaths.

In 2023, another Category 3 storm,left as many as 500,000 customers without power after it struck the northwest coast of Florida, also causing major flood damage from storm surge. Idalia was the most powerful hurricane to hit Florida’s Big Bend region since 1950.

Helene is the eighth named storm of the current Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to November 30, and the fourth to make landfall in the US.struck the Gulf Coast of Louisiana as a Category 2 storm barely two weeks ago.

Since 2000, only three other years besides 2024 have had four or more storms make landfall in the continental US.

This year’s hurricane season coincides withhit by rising fees and reluctance from private insurers to provide coverage in coastal areas.

The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationthis year because of record-setting warm ocean temperatures. It forecast 17 to 25 named storms, with four to seven major hurricanes of Category 3 or higher.

But the season is off to a slow start, leaving forecasters searching for factors that may have impeded the formation of major storms as they cross the Atlantic Ocean “hurricane corridor”.'''

* Sept. 25, 2024Updated12:35 p.m. ET

From girl scouts to first aid responders, cleaners to electrical engineers, the names and faces of the Lebanese civilians killed by Israeli airstrikes this week have begun to emerge, as the nation reels from the deadliest day in its history since the 15-year civil war, which ended in 1990.

Hundreds of people have been killed since Israel began launching airstrikes in Lebanon on Sunday, in what it describes as a campaign targeting the militant group Hezbollah and its weapons stores.

Many Lebanese are still taking stock of those lost on Monday, when Israeli strikes killed 558 people in a single day, according to Lebanon’s health ministry. The toll includes 50 children and 94 women.

Among them was Dina Darwiche, an employee of the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR. Her body was found along with that of her youngest son after an Israeli missile hit the building where they lived in Lebanon’s eastern Bekaa region.

Friends wrote tributes to Ms. Darwiche on social media, many of them posting a selfie of her smiling and posing with the son who was killed with her. Others shared a video of a U.N. campaign she ran in previous years against gender-based violence.

“She had been dedicated to her humanitarian work with UNHCR for as long as I can remember,” her friend, Jasmin Diab, posted on the social media platform X. “I am broken. I am absolutely destroyed. I cannot breathe. When will the world let us breathe?!”

> Abstract:We introduce derangetropy, a novel functional measure designed to characterize the dynamics of information within probability distributions. Unlike scalar measures such as Shannon entropy, derangetropy offers a functional representation that captures the dispersion of information across the entire support of a distribution. By incorporating self-referential and periodic properties, it provides deeper insights into information dynamics governed by differential equations and equilibrium states. Through combinatorial justifications and empirical analysis, we demonstrate the utility of derangetropy in depicting distribution behavior and evolution, providing a new tool for analyzing complex and hierarchical systems in information theory.

September is National Suicide Prevention month, and September 17<sup>th</sup>of each year is is National Physician Suicide Awareness Day. While this day is named to specifically call awareness to physician suicide, it allows us all to use this month to recognize the health concerns of our entire licensed healthcare workforce. And there are many.

In the United States of America, according to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and data presented at the 2018 American Psychiatric Association national meeting, more than 300-400 doctors die by suicide each year. One a day. And while the risk of dying by suicide is higher for physicians compared to the general population, a study in JAMA in September 2023 showed that it is higher for nurses – specifically registered nurses – as well. This awareness day is a call to action to healthcare leaders and policy makers to continue to create environments that support optimal physical and mental wellness for all healthcare personnel.

Douglas Olson

Physicians are 40% more likely than workers in other fields to report suicidal ideation – 7.1% versus 4.3% according to a 2021 study by Dr. Tait Shanafelt and colleagues. Our nation’s caregivers do not enter the profession to have it end prematurely by suicide. As we move further away from the COVID pandemic, licensed healthcare personnel are still facing the same issues they were prior: One meta-analysis from researchers at Harvard estimated the depression rate among doctors in training at 29% compared to 8% of non-physicians. These feelings can lead to burnout and, when left untreated, can cause more cases of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance misuse. The American Medical Association and the Federation of State Physician Health Programs have highlighted this for years.

Beyond the basic and tragic loss of life, over 1 million patients a year are impacted by losing a physician due to suicide.

Licensed healthcare professionals with mental illness face particular stigma. Medical licensing and credentialing bodies as well as hospitals, clinics and insurance companies traditionally have required applicants to disclose any history of psychiatric treatment or impairment. The mental health questions typically focus on whether the applicant merely has a history of a psychiatric diagnosis or has ever received treatment for mental illness. There is no similar requirement for reporting physical health diagnoses or treatment.

The Joint Commission, which accredits hospitals, has emphasized since 2020 that it doesn’t require hospitals to ask about an applicant’s mental health history beyond conditions that currently impair the clinicians’ ability to perform their job. “We strongly encourage organizations to not ask about past history of mental health conditions or treatment” the Commission has said. Yet for most institutions this has not changed and these questions are still asked. This deters many health workers from seeking treatment they need – that their patients need them to get – to deliver safe, high quality and efficient care. Hospitals, clinics and organizations that have not changed this can – and should. For the lives of our country’s health workers, indeed, they must.

Los Centros de Servicios de Medicare y Medicaidy a Athena que debido a que “la instalación no cumple con los requisitos básicos de salud y seguridad de Medicare”, la financiación se detendría a partir del 10 de septiembre para cualquier paciente nuevo y dentro de los 30 días para todos los pacientes.

La medida sin precedentes de los funcionarios federales cerrará en efecto la instalación de 205 camas porque la mayoría de sus residentes son beneficiarios de Medicaid o Medicare y no pagadores privados. Se produce en medio de crecientes problemas financieros y preocupaciones de los legisladores sobre la atención a los pacientes en las instalaciones de Athena.

Esto es lo que debe saber.
### **¿Por qué Abbott Terrace Health Center perdió la financiación?**

Los funcionarios del Departamento de Salud Pública realizaron varias visitas a Abbott Terrace los primeros seis meses de este año, durante las cuales se plantearon preocupaciones sobre la propia instalación y la atención a los pacientes. Las inspecciones mostraron escasez de personal, en particular de enfermeras, grandes agujeros en los pisos de baldosas y al menos un incidente en el que un empleado le dijo a un residente con problemas de incontinencia que “podían olerlos en el pasillo”.

El sitio web federal de Medicarepara Abbott Terrace, con inspecciones de salud “muy por debajo del promedio” y medidas de calidad “por debajo del promedio”.
### **¿Cómo respondió Athena a esas preocupaciones?**

Una portavoz de la empresa dijo que el Departamento de Salud Pública, o DPH, había ordenado actualizaciones en el edificio, en particular en el piso, y Athena invirtió $200,000 dólares en renovar los pisos.

La empresa también había “destinado dólares adicionales” para más mejoras, dijo la portavoz, Savannah Ragali. No especificó una cantidad.

“Nuestro equipo hizo todo lo posible en las últimas semanas para abordar las preocupaciones de la planta física identificadas por el DPH”, dijo Ragali. “Hemos invertido importantes recursos financieros en devolver nuestra instalación al cumplimiento mediante la mejora de pisos, puertas y otras infraestructuras identificadas de la instalación. Creíamos que los problemas identificados se habían resuelto con éxito”.
### **¿Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, o CMS, le otorgó una suspensión a Abbott Terrace?**

Tras los informes de que CMS había otorgado una suspensión a Abbott Terrace, Ragali dijo que el hogar de ancianos “no ha sido notificado de ningún cambio en su estado” y continúa preparándose para cerrar.

Cuando se les preguntó si se había otorgado una suspensión, los funcionarios estatales remitieron al Connecticut Mirror a CMS.

Un portavoz de CMS se negó a confirmarlo o negarlo, afirmando: “Para proteger la integridad de nuestro proceso de encuesta, no podemos proporcionar información adicional en este momento”.
### **¿Qué significará el cierre para los residentes y el personal de Abbott Terrace?**

Los residentes han comenzado a recibir avisos de alta antes del cierre, dijo Mairead Painter, la defensora del Pueblo de Atención a Largo Plazo del Estado.

Ragali dijo que Abbott Terrace está buscando ubicaciones para que sus residentes se muden y posibles transferencias a otros sitios de Athena para sus casi 300 empleados.

“Los residentes que han decidido voluntariamente darse de alta del centro están siendo dados de alta en virtud de sus derechos”, dijo Ragali. “Según la investigación de nuestro personal en Abbott Terrace, hay 110 camas para enfermería especializadas en un radio de 15 millas de Abbott Terrace, y ninguna cama disponible en una unidad segura para demencia”.

Painter dijo que su personal en la Oficina del Defensor del Pueblo para Cuidados a Largo Plazo también está trabajando con los residentes de Abbott Terrace para garantizar que se protejan sus derechos y se tengan en cuenta sus preferencias.

La Comisionada del Departamento de Salud Pública, Manisha Juthani, y la Comisionada del Departamento de Servicios Sociales, Andrea Barton Reeves, dijeron que el anuncio no significa que los residentes de Abbott hayan perdido su cobertura. Los residentes seguirán estando cubiertos cuando se trasladen a un centro que participe en los programas Medicare y Medicaid.

Connecticut is contending with a growing trend of viral school shooting threats, with more than 30 assessed by the state’s central intelligence authority since the beginning of the school year.

The uptick is part of a broader spike in such threats nationwide, after four people were killed in aon Sept. 4. Since then, schools across Connecticut have suspended classes as threats have come in via phone calls and social media. On Friday alone, schools were closed in Bristol, Torrington and Bridgeport.

Students in Norwalk, Bridgeport and New Haven have also arrived in school to see an additional police presence on their campuses following threats this month, while children in West Haven, New Britain and North Haven experienced lockdowns.

But officials say that while school closures and early dismissals may be frightening, the high numbers of reported threats can actually be read as a sign that efforts to instill a “see something, say something” mentality have paid off in a state that witnessed the deadliest shooting at an elementary school in U.S. history, at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown.

“We’ve got a lot of people willing to tell us, and that’s important for prevention,” said Tim Silva, a manager at the Connecticut Intelligence Center, which assesses such threats.

Gov. Ned Lamont told reporters on Friday that most of the threats are just reposts.

“They think they’re being funny. They’re not. We have to respond to each and every one of them,” he said.

Officials say that in addition to encouraging people to continue to report concerning posts or comments, there should be consequences for those who make the threats. This includes arresting students who post threats online, to discourage others from reposting such messages, disrupting learning and putting communities on edge. Over the past month, children from Ansonia to Bridgeport have been arrested in connection with the threats.

“We hope people understand that there is a consequence to what they do,” Silva said. “They want to get out of a test, whatever it may be. This discourages them from doing it.”

Most of the state’s school districts that contended with threats managed to communicate effectively with their communities, according to Kate Dias, president of the Connecticut Education Association, the largest teachers union in the state. But in Bridgeport, angry and frightened parents and teachers spoke out at a Board of Education meeting on Monday night about what they say was a botched response.

For Jacqueline Colantonio, an ESL teacher, that meant finding out late in the day on Wednesday, Sept. 18, that a threat had been made in the morning that affected her school.

“The whole staff was in the cafeteria, where there’s a wall of windows and doors open to a courtyard that’s open to the public. We were sitting ducks and we knew nothing,” she said.

According to officials in the Bridgeport school district, that threat was non-credible. It was assessed and deemed to be a hoax, and parents received a notification from the school after that determination had been made. But teaching staff didn’t receive the same notification until hours later.

The superintendent emailed staff and apologized for that lag, writing that the school’s automated system had been corrected. “We are committed to continuous improvement to ensure that all staff members are notified simultaneously about critical matters,” Superintendent Carmela Levy-David wrote.

But Colantonio said that the lag in communication changed her perception of safety at the school.

“I’ve been teaching for 27 years, and I’ve never had a concern about coming to school — until now,” Colantonio said.

Bridgeport schools were cancelled on Friday after an additional threat led to an arrest. When students returned to school on Monday there was an increased police presence.

Sen. Herron Gaston, co-chair of the legislature’s Public Safety and Security Committee and a Democrat who represents Bridgeport, said schools must balance security concerns with the negative impact of over-surveillance.

“Black students are four times as likely as students of other races to be enrolled in high surveillance schools and communities. Students who are a part of these access-limited communities can find themselves paying a safety tax which impacts their academic outcomes,” Gaston said.

More support is needed to support students’ mental health, he said.

“We need to focus on providing services to our young people to address the root causes that lead to violent behavior,” Gaston said. “We need to invest in social programs that can reduce feelings of isolation, hopelessness and anger, which I believe research shows are common drivers of this violence.”

Tim Kearney, the chief behavioral health officer for Community Health Center, Inc, which has a presence in more than 150 Connecticut schools, says that students are afraid and they’re reaching out for support.

“There are more coming and the ones coming are more distressed,” Kearney said. “Every time they hear something, they wonder, ‘Is it gonna happen here? Is the next one gonna be me?'”

To combat that fear, Kearney encourages children and their parents to have open conversations.

“Try to talk about it together. Make a plan. Say, ‘We’re gonna do these things. We hope they never happen, but we need a plan to be safe.'”
