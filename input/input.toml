He also committed to sitting down with pharmacy benefit managers – middlemen who negotiate drug rebates with manufacturers on behalf of insurers – to "collaborate on anything that helps patients get access and affordability."</p><p>That pledge came after Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who chairs the Senate panel, said he received commitments in writing from all of the major PBMs that they would not limit coverage of Wegovy and Ozempic if Novo Nordisk reduced their list prices.The hearing comes roughly five months after Sanders opened an investigation into the Danish drugmaker's pricing practices. </p><p>"All we are saying, Mr. Jørgensen, is treat the American people the same way that you treat people all over the world," Sanders said during the hearing Tuesday. "Stop ripping us off."</p><p>He noted that Novo Nordisk has raked in nearly $50 billion in sales from Wegovy and Ozempic, with most of that revenue coming from the U.S. Sanders contends that Novo Nordisk charges Americans substantially higher prices for its blockbuster drugs than it does for patients in other countries. Before insurance, Ozempic costs nearly <a href="https://www.novocare.com/diabetes/products/ozempic/explaining-list-price.html" target="_blank">$969 per month</a> and Wegovy costs almost <a href="https://www.novocare.com/obesity/products/wegovy/let-us-help/explaining-list-price.html" target="_blank">$1,350 per month</a> in the U.S. </p></div><div data-test="InlineImage" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-108038386"><div>U.S. Sen.

The company has argued that it needs to be able to pay rebates to those middlemen to get their drugs on formularies, or lists of medications covered by insurance.</p><p>Jørgensen noted that the written promises that Sanders received from PBMs are "new information to me," but said he understands "that perhaps the PBMs have changed their minds."</p><p>Novo Nordisk has argued that it has spent billions to research, develop and expand manufacturing for the treatments and is funneling more money into researching their potential to treat other obesity-related health conditions. That investment has extended and improved the lives of millions of Americans, which helps reduce the health-care costs associated with obesity and diabetes, according to written testimony from Jørgensen.</p></div><div id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-108038385" data-test="InlineImage"><div>Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Jorgensen testifies before a Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee hearing on U.S. prices for the weight loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., September 24, 2024. </div><div>Piroschka Van De Wouw | Reuters</div></div><div><p>During the hearing, Jørgensen said the company has fought to secure public and private insurance coverage for the medications.</p><p>He also in part blamed the "complex U.S. healthcare system" for making it difficult for patients to access affordable prescription drugs, noting that "no single company alone can solve such vast and complicated policy challenges."</p><p>Jørgensen promised that Novo Nordisk will "remain engaged and work with this committee on policy solutions to address the structural issues that drive up costs."</p><DIV>But Jørgensen contended that lowering prices could have consequences, saying it could lead to less insurance coverage.<p>In his written testimony, Jørgensen said Novo Nordisk's insulin product Levemir was previously available to 90% of U.S. patients through formularies.

That's $5 billion more than what Americans spent on all prescription drugs in 2022. </p><p>Medicare spent <a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/medicare-spending-on-ozempic-and-other-glp-1s-is-skyrocketing/" target="_blank">$4.6 billion on Ozempic</a> in 2022 alone, according to health policy research organization KFF. </p><p>Other insurers and employers have implemented strict requirements to control weight loss drug costs, or have dropped coverage of those treatments altogether. Many health plans cover GLP-1s for diabetes, but not for weight loss. The federal Medicare program doesn't pay for weight loss treatments unless they are approved and prescribed for another health condition. </p><p>The hearing comes as the Biden administration and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle try to rein in health-care costs in the U.S., in part by pressuringthe pharmaceutical industry and drug supply chain middlemen.

Low global demand forecasts, coupled with new oil supply coming from non-OPEC countries, spell a long period of subdued crude prices. </p><p>It's led some in the market to ask the question: Have we officially reached "peak oil"? Has demand growth hit its apex, and is it just downhill from here?</p><p>By the forecasts of OPEC itself, that's a hard no. </p><p>The oil producer group's 2024 World Oil Outlook report, released Tuesday, predicts strong energy demand growth of 24% globally between now and 2050. It also forecasts "robust medium-term growth" in oil demand reaching 112.3 million barrels per day in 2029, an increase of 10.1 million barrels per day compared to 2023.</p><p>A fair number of energy analysts appear to disagree with that calculation — not least those at the International Energy Agency. The Paris-based agency sees demand actually leveling off by the end of the decade to around 106 million barrels per day, according to its <a href="https://www.iea.org/news/slowing-demand-growth-and-surging-supply-put-global-oil-markets-on-course-for-major-surplus-this-decade" target="_blank">annual mid-term outlook published in June</a>. The IEA still sees global oil demand rising; it just forecasts a smaller rise, and expects it to peak by the end of the decade. </p></div><div><p>The battle of the forecasts between OPEC and the IEA has gained publicity in recent years, with the latter organization pushing hard for a net-zero future. </p><p>S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, meanwhile, sees the medium-term future as somewhere in between, with demand reaching a peak of 109 million barrels per day in 2034 and gradually declining to fall below 100 million barrels per day in 2050. </p><p>OPEC, by contrast, sees demand hitting a whopping 120 million barrels per day by 2050. </p><p>All parties agree that demand will fall in the developing world, while rising in emerging markets led by India. </p></div><h2>The medium-term outlook</h2><div><p>As for the near-to-medium term outlook, analysts are bearish on oil demand and prices. This is despite the early September announcement by OPEC+ that the group would be extending its crude production cuts into December in an attempt to limit market supply.</p><p>"That two month extra time hasn't convinced anybody who's skeptical about the market that that's going to do much to shore up prices," Dave Ernsberger, head of market reporting at S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, told CNBC. </p><p>"So that's the in-the-moment issue. But the much bigger issue is, existentially speaking, are we moving past the moment of peak oil demand?"</p><p>Ernsberger pointed to the growth of alternative energy forms, including the increasing use of biofuels in the maritime industry. </p><p>"What we're moving into is an era of post-demand growth. It's not a post-oil moment, but it's a post-growth moment. And how does OPEC+, how does the market readjust to a world of low or no growth in demand overall?"</p></div><div><p>Price increase prospects are also dimmed by China, the world's largest oil importer, which has put itself on a dedicated path to electrification. </p><p>"The biggest threats to higher prices for OPEC+ are external," Li-Chen Sim, a non-resident scholar at the Washington-based Middle East Institute, told CNBC. </p><p>Those are chiefly "lackluster demand, especially from China, oil supply from non-OPEC+ sources, and internal; some members are producing more than assigned quotas."</p><p>Estimates by international and Chinese sources show a slowing demand for oil and refined products in China, Sim said. </p><p>That is in part due to slowing Chinese economic growth of around 3% to 5% annually in recent years — still better than many other countries, she noted. </p><p>"But there's also a structural element to the reduction in oil consumption, driven by a conscious effort to reduce its high dependence on oil (and gas) imports, and expressed in policies such as electric vehicle uptake and encouraging expansion of renewable and nuclear power," Sim added.</p><p>In the near term, OPEC+ is still expected to bring some production back in December, several countries in the alliance are producing beyond their quotas, and more supply is coming onto the market from non-OPEC+ producers like the U.S., Guyana, Brazil, and Canada. </p><p>"It's difficult to see prices moving much higher from here as long as that threat is out there in the market to bring those supplies back," Ernsberger said.</p><p>In the much longer term, the eventual decline of the oil era – if it happens – will be brought on due to changing demand rather than dwindling supply, many analysts argue.</p><p>It was the late Saudi Sheikh Ahmed Zaki Yamani who <a href="https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/acref/9780191826719.001.0001/q-oro-ed4-00017466" target="_blank">said in 2000</a>: "The Stone Age came to an end not for a lack of stones and the Oil Age will end, but not for a lack of oil."</p></div></div></article>'''

<article><DIV id="readability-page-1"><DIV><p><em>Mohamed Muizzu also tells the UNGA that Israel is targeting journalists to cover up its ‘crimes’ in Gaza and Lebanon.</em></p></DIV><div aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"><p>Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu has told the United Nations that Israel must be held accountable for the crimes it is committing in Gaza, including “genocide”, as well as its attacks on journalists and other violations of international law.</p>
<p>“The ongoing massacre, the genocide by Israel in Gaza is a travesty of justice and the international system,” the leader of the Indian Ocean archipelago told the UN General Assembly in New York on Tuesday.</p>
<p>He said Israel’s killing of civilians and its “repeated destruction” of homes, hospitals, and schools in Gaza was now being extended to Lebanon.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Israel and Hezbollah again <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2024/9/24/israel-attacks-lebanon-live-global-calls-for-restraint-as-492-killed" target="_blank">traded cross-border fire,</a> a day after the Israeli military launched a wave of air attacks into Lebanon that have killed at least 569 people so far.</p>
<p>Israel’s new offensive against Hezbollah has stoked fears that nearly a year of conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza will explode into a larger regional conflagration.</p>
<p>The Israeli military is shifting its focus from Gaza to the northern frontier, where Hezbollah has been firing rockets into Israel in support of Hamas, which is also backed by Iran.</p>
<p>Israel has made a war priority of securing its northern border and allowing for the return of displaced residents. This has set the stage for a long conflict, while Hezbollah has said it will not back down until a ceasefire is reached in Gaza.</p>
<p>Muizzu also said Israel was attempting to cover up its crimes by targeting Palestinian and Lebanese journalists, including by <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/22/israel-closes-al-jazeera-bureau-in-ramallah-all-you-need-to-know" target="_blank">closing Al Jazeera bureaus</a> in Israel and the occupied West Bank.</p>
<p>“How can we interpret this as anything other than brutal attempts to prevent the world from knowing the crimes taking place?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Israel must be held accountable for these acts of terrorism, for these violations of international law and UN resolutions.”</p>



<p>In June, Muizzu said his government will ban Israelis from the Maldives, known for idyllic beaches and luxury resorts, as public anger in the predominantly Muslim nation was rising over Israel’s war in Gaza, which has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, displaced nearly all of the population, and left much of the enclave in ruins.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, he called for the world to accept a sovereign and independent Palestinian state on the pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.</p>
<p>“Now, we must ensure that Palestine becomes a full member of the UN,” he added.</p>
<p>In May, the UNGA <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/10/un-backs-palestines-bid-for-membership-how-did-your-country-vote" target="_blank">backed</a> a Palestinian bid to become a full UN member by recognising it as qualified to join and recommending the UN Security Council “reconsider the matter favourably”. The <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/4/18/palestinian-bid-for-un-membership-set-for-security-council-vote" target="_blank">United States had vetoed</a> a Palestinian bid to become a full UN member at the Security Council in April.</p>



<h2 id="muizzu-makes-climate-crisis-plea">Muizzu makes climate crisis plea</h2>
<p>Muizzu also asked world leaders on Tuesday for additional support in combatting the climate crisis, which is threatening the existence of the world’s lowest-lying country.</p>
<p>“Climate change is the most serious threat to our world, the defining challenge of our generation. It’s washing away decades of progress in mere minutes,” he said.</p>
<p>“It’s diverting already depleted resources for long-term development to emergency relief and reconstruction, preventing countries from adapting to the climate impact.”</p>
<p>He called on rich countries and the worst emitters of carbon to not only meet exisiting financial pledges made to developing countries to help them adapt to climate change, but also to extend that funding when the 2024 UN Climate Change Conference, more commonly known as COP29, takes place in November.</p>
<p>“As we work towards COP 29, we must ensure the new goal on climate finance matches the level of climate action required.”</p>

<article><DIV id="readability-page-1"><DIV><p><em>Attack launched as world leaders, including Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, gather in New York for the UN General Assembly.</em></p></DIV><div aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"><p>Russia has hit the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv with guided bombs, killing at least three people and wounding dozens, according to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p>
<p>“The targets of the Russian bombs were an apartment building, a bakery, a stadium. In other words, the everyday life of ordinary people,” said <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/24/zelenskyy-seeks-us-investments-in-ukraines-battered-energy-sector" target="_blank">Zelenskyy</a> on Tuesday, posting a statement on X about the attack, which also left dozens injured.</p>
<p>He posted a picture showing the facade of a nine-storey apartment block partially ripped off, the windows blown out and debris strewn across the street.</p>
<p>Kharkiv regional governor Oleh Syniehubov reported that 31 were injured.</p>
<p>“People are still trapped under the rubble. One of the multistorey buildings suffered a direct hit. The rescue operation continues,” he wrote on Telegram.</p>
<p>The northeastern city of <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/16/at-least-one-killed-dozens-injured-as-russian-bomb-hits-kharkiv-apartments" target="_blank">Kharkiv</a> lies about 30km (18 miles) from the Russian border and has been pounded by Russian aerial attacks throughout the two-and-a-half-year war.</p>
<p>Kharkiv mayor Ihor Terekhov said on Telegram that the nine-storey block had already been attacked by Russia at the start of the war.</p>
<p>“It was almost repaired, windows were installed, it was insulated, and prepared for the heating season. The enemy hit it a second time,” he said, adding that the section of the building that suffered most damage was housing 82 people.</p>
<p>In total, Russia launched eight guided bombs, six of which hit Kharkiv, according to regional prosecutors on Telegram.</p>
<p>Ukrainian air defences struggle to intercept the highly destructive bombs.</p>



<p>The afternoon assault was launched as world leaders, including the Ukrainian president, gathered in New York for the United Nations General Assembly, discussing the wars in Gaza, Sudan and Ukraine.</p>
<p>“There is much discussion now at the UN General Assembly about collective efforts for security and the future,” said Zelenskyy. “But we just need to stop the terror. To have security. To have a future.”</p>
<p>Kyiv, which is pressing allies to allow deep strikes into Russia, says the most effective means of reducing the attacks is to target not the bombs themselves but planes and airfields hosting them.</p>
<p>“We are counting on the courage to allow us to attack military targets in enemy territory with Western weapons,” said Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, commenting on Tuesday’s attacks.</p>
<p>Also on Tuesday, Ukrainian soldiers drove Russian forces out of a processing plant in the town of <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/16/is-russias-assault-on-northeastern-ukraine-already-losing-steam" target="_blank">Vovchansk</a> in the Kharkiv border region, which had been occupied for four months, according to a statement from Ukrainian military intelligence.</p>
<p>The plant, a partly steel structure with some 30 buildings, had been a Russian stronghold in the country’s northeast since Russia launched a new push in the area in May.</p>
<p>Ukraine’s incursion last month into Russia’s <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/16/ukraine-invites-un-and-red-cross-to-kyiv-controlled-kursk" target="_blank">Kursk</a> region, where Ukrainian forces are holding ground, was launched in part to ease pressure in the northeast by forcing Russia to divert its forces.</p>

            <p>LOS ANGELES — Owen Han didn’t know how much the internet loves sandwiches when he posted a TikTok video of grilled chicken, bacon, smashed avocado and chipotle mayo between two slices of sourdough bread one day in the summer of 2021. But he soon found out.</p>
<p>“It was my first video to break a million views,” says Han in his Venice studio apartment, where a large kitchen takes up most of the small, tidy space, outfitted with a six-burner range with built-in griddle, more knives and pans than some restaurants and a deli-style meat slicer.</p>
<p>“The way in which it happened was kind of just by chance,” he says. “I was planning on filming a cioppino, which is a fish stew. It takes a lot of time, has a lot of ingredients, and I was feeling a little bit lazy, so I was like, ‘You know what? Let me just film making my lunch.'”</p>
<p>Three years later, Han has a following of 4.3 million on TikTok, 2.2 million on Instagram and nearly 800,000 dedicated YouTube fans. His first cookbook, “Stacked: The Art of Making the Perfect Sandwich,” will be released by Harvest on Oct. 15, when he kicks off a coast-to-coast tour. And he has just returned from cooking at a pop-up in Ibiza and a cheesemaking tour in Oregon with Tillamook, one of the many brands wooing him for content.</p>
<p>Even by TikTok standards, which have created a new equation for fame, Han’s rise was meteoric. Based on the success of that chicken-bacon-avo sando, “I just figured, let me try another one, which happened to be the steak sandwich, which is on the [cookbook] cover, and that broke 10 million views. I was like, wow, this is crazy. People like sandwiches, and I also like sharing my passion for sandwiches.”</p>

<p>He followed that up with a breakfast sandwich. “And then from there, people were already dubbing me ‘the sandwich guy.’ It kind of has a good ring to it,” says Han, being modest.</p>
<p>He was already the Sandwich King.</p>

<p>‘It’s a comfort thing’</p>
<p>And that was just the start. His tomahawk steak sammie has reached almost 13 million TikTok views. Chicken tikka wrap: 16.6 million. Open-face ham and cheese: 24 million. Beef shawarma wrapped in laffa: 52.3 million (that’s more than the entire population of South Korea).</p>
<p>Tall and dark-haired, Han barely speaks in a majority of his videos. They almost always start the same: He squishes the sandwich, cuts into it with a smooth slice or thwacking chop, takes a big crunchy bite and beams a big smile. And though quick edits and ASMR are nothing new to social media, the way he slaps deli meats and splatters sauces on bread obviously resonates with his audience.</p>

<p>Why do people love sandwiches so much? “I think what it comes down to is it’s a comfort thing, it’s such a comforting food,” says Han. “I mean, tons of memories come to mind,” including his Italian grandmother’s pan e Nutella and the sandwich of the day at his high school cafeteria in Sarasota, Florida. “I loved the cafeteria staff. I remember super vividly Friday was tuna melts. Thursday was burger. No matter what was being served, I’m always getting the sandwich.”</p>
<p>Born in Milan and raised in Florida, Han spent summers with his grandmother in a tiny village in the mountains of Tuscany, with no Wi-Fi until recently. “So there wasn’t really much to do besides spend your time outside running around or watch Nonna cook,” he says. “And I was much more a fan of staying in the kitchen with her.”</p>
<p>Pasta was the first thing he learned to make, and Nonna – along with Han’s Shanghainese father – instilled in him a passion for food, especially her cucina povera: sugo di pomodoro, stracotto (pot roast), carbonara, turkey braised with vegetables and wine, pizza from her outdoor oven.</p>
<p>She enrolled him in a cooking class at a local restaurant, but he’s otherwise a self-taught chef who studied economics and nutrition at USC. After college he landed a job as a “nutrition ambassador” at a hospital in Los Angeles. “That’s a fancy way of saying I was delivering food to patients and taking their orders,” he says.</p>
<p>That’s when his life took a turn. In April 2021 his father – a former concert pianist who helped spark Han’s passion for cooking – died due to COVID-19. Han writes in his book that after his father’s death, returning to his job “where I was constantly surrounded by families undergoing similar hardships and pain was extremely difficult. At that point in time, a typical workday consisted of me crying in the bathroom for hours while neglecting my work.”</p>
<p>His roommate at the time, H. Woo Lee, was posting food videos to TikTok and, because Han loved to cook, encouraged him to do the same. “I really owe it to him for encouraging me to start,” Han says.</p>
<p>“I had an Instagram at the time, but I was too embarrassed to post food content,” Han says. “Because there were 800 people I know that followed me, I was like, ‘I’m not gonna embarrass myself there.’ So I went on this new platform, TikTok.”</p>
<p>Among the first videos to go viral was shrimp toast, based on a recipe from his Chinese grandmother’s cookbook, passed down to him by his father. He takes the stained, barely bound-together copy of “Recipes: Chinese Cooking” from the bookcase in his kitchen (where there’s also a trophy inscribed with “Sandwich King Owen Han,” a gift from Bon Appétit personality Brad Leone) and shows where she wrote “celery leave (sic) chopped” on the page. “She had some edits in here,” he says.</p>
<p>By the time his first chicken sandwich hit a million views and the first brands reached out to him, he had quit his hospital job, turned down an offer to work in operations at Roscoe’s Chicken &amp; Waffles in Hollywood and decided to focus full-time on sandwich content.</p>
<p>Is lasagna a sandwich?</p>
<p>On a recent August day, he’s standing at the stove stirring the tomato sauce for polpette, a recipe from Nonna. But “Nonna never made meatball subs,” Han says. “I doubt she knew what a meatball sub was.” Until he shot a video of making one with her in Italy this summer.</p>
<p>“She was really weirded out by eating [meatballs] in a sandwich. But she was like, ‘This is actually very good.'”</p>
<p>Nonna’s meatballs are especially tender, bound by milk-soaked bread (rather than traditional breadcrumbs or panko) and beaten egg. One key to a good meatball sub is not to oversauce, Han says. “Nobody likes soggy bread.”</p>
<p>Han has cooked and made videos with Nonna, Giada De Laurentiis, Martha Stewart, Alex Guarnaschelli and Padma Lakshmi. When he explained to Stewart his broad definition of a sandwich – any stackable ingredients with a flour/bread component – “She was quick. She said, ‘Does that mean lasagna is a sandwich?'”</p>
<p>But you can’t eat lasagna with your hands, I respond.</p>
<p>“I have,” Han says.</p>
<p>The “Stacked” cookbook includes recipes for tacos, burgers, burritos and wraps, a quesadilla, chicken and waffles, as well as more traditional sandwich styles, both classic and inventive. (But no lasagna.)</p>
<p>Mining his Italian and Chinese heritage and inspiration from social media, “I have yet to run out of ideas,” says Han, who estimates he has made nearly 1,000 sandwiches since becoming a self-described sandwich influencer and keeps a continual list of ideas on his phone.</p>
<p>“It’s definitely a fear of mine, but if I’m ever at a dead end or lacking inspiration, I will just pull that up. … There are times where I will literally wake up from a dream or a nap, and will come up with an idea and I’ll just add it to that tab.”</p>
<p>When asked about critics of TikTok cooking content who point out that 30-second videos are more entertainment than instructional, he says, “I fully agree. There is some instructional element to the short videos, because if you slow it down or watch it enough times, [you] get the gist of it.”</p>
<p>But, he says, he was inspired to write a cookbook partly because he receives comments and DMs with requests for recipes. “I wanted to share my story and recipes with people.”</p>
<p>His cookbook proposal stood out because Han is “authentic, charming, genuinely loves to cook and comes by this naturally,” says Harvest executive editor Sarah Pelz. With his fan base, “He has a direct connection with them. We’ve seen this with authors who have big social media platforms. I think readers feel they know this person. So there’s a very personal connection” that publishers can’t create for authors.</p>
<p>That’s what catapulted “Baking Yesteryear” by B. Dylan Hollis, who makes retro recipes such as Kool-Aid pies and chocolate syrup cakes, to the No. 1 spot on the New York Times bestseller list. Other cookbooks from TikTok creators have climbed the bestseller list, including “An Unapologetic Cookbook” by Joshua Weissman and “The Korean Vegan” by Joanne Lee Molinaro.</p>
<p>The next frontier for Han is YouTube, he says, where he has been experimenting with a couple of cooking series. One is “Ciao Chow” – “like Italian ‘ciao’ and Chinese ‘chow'” – with Han’s mashups such as dan dan Bolognese. The other is “My Nonna Knows,” in which Han consults with his grandmother via FaceTime and she rates his renditions of classic Italian dishes.</p>
<p>“I definitely want to continue pushing out long-form content on my YouTube,” he says. Once the book tour is done, he plans to make YouTube his main focus and come up with another series.</p>
<p>“Right now I don’t even speak in my [social media] videos, so one, it’s a great way to let the audience kind of see a different side of me, and then also to experiment. And show that I can cook more than just sandwiches.”</p>

            <p>I’m pretty old-school when it comes frying or roasting chicken, usually cooking breasts and thighs in the trusty cast-iron skillet I inherited years ago from my mother.</p>
<p>My kids? Now that they’re on their own, they prefer to do all their frying in an air fryer, a time-saving, user-friendly appliance that makes cooking faster, easier and, in most cases, a little healthier, too.</p>
<p>The egg-shaped cookers produce crispy fried foods with a fraction of the oil used in traditional cooking. All you need is a tiny spritz of oil in the fryer basket or on the food being cooked and you’re good to go.</p>
<p>So when one of my twin daughters came to visit, I felt obligated to pull my air fryer off the shelf in my pantry, dust it off and actually put it to use for the first time in, well, forever.</p>
<p>It helps that I had the perfect recipe already in hand: a banh mi-like sandwich featuring tender chunks of chicken thigh doused in a spicy-sweet bang bang sauce.</p>

<p>Every family makes their own version of the creamy, mayonnaise-based dip that’s often associated with the shrimp dish of the same name.</p>
<p>Per my daughter Catherine, ours includes a teaspoon of smoked paprika and a squeeze of fresh lime juice along with the requisite Sriracha and spicy-sweet tang of another favorite Asian condiment: Thai sweet chili sauce.</p>

<p>A perfect balance of heat, salt, sweet and acid, bang bang sauce is often used as a dressing or dipping sauce for egg rolls or french fries. Here, it’s a tasty marinade for chicken thigh kebabs cooked to crispy perfection in the air fryer, and then stuffed into a soft roll and topped with pickled carrots and radish.</p>
<p>Garnish with chopped scallion or chives and, if you really want to spice it up, a dusting of red pepper flakes.</p>
<p>Additionally, you also could serve the chicken with the veggies on top or with white or brown rice as a rice bowl.</p>

<p>Bang Bang Chicken Skewers</p>
<p>PG Tested</p>
<p>For sauce</p>
<p>1/2 cup mayonnaise</p>
<p>1 tablespoon Sriracha sauce</p>
<p>2 tablespoons Thai sweet chili sauce</p>
<p>1 clove garlic, minced</p>
<p>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</p>
<p>2 teaspoons rice vinegar</p>
<p>Juice 1/2 lime</p>
<p>Pinch of salt</p>
<p>For quick-pickled veggies</p>
<p>1 cup julienned or shredded carrot</p>
<p>1 cup julienned or shredded daikon radish</p>
<p>1/3 cup rice vinegar</p>
<p>1/3 cup water</p>
<p>1 tablespoon sugar</p>
<p>1 teaspoon salt</p>
<p>For skewers</p>
<p>1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thigh</p>
<p>Wooden or metal skewers, for cooking</p>
<p>1 baguette, cut into 6-inch lengths, and sliced open (you should get 4 pieces)</p>
<p>Chopped chives or green onion, for garnish</p>
<p>Japanese or Korean chili flakes, for garnish (optional)</p>
<p>Prepare sauce: Place mayonnaise, Sriracha, chili sauce, garlic, paprik, rice vinegar and lime juice in a large bowl. (You will be adding chicken.) Stir well to combine, then season to taste with salt. If it’s not spicy enough, add more Sriracha. Reserve about 1/4 cup in another small bowl (for drizzling) and set aside.</p>
<p>Place shredded carrots and radish in a small bowl. In small saucepan, combine water, vinegar, sugar and a pinch of salt and bring to boil on medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Stir occasionally. Remove from the heat and cool it down.</p>
<p>Pour over carrot mixture. Let cool to room temperature; cover and refrigerate until ready to use.</p>
<p>Cut chicken thigh into large cubes. Add to large bowl with bang bang sauce, and stir to combine, making sure all the cubes are well coated in sauce.</p>
<p>If using bamboo skewers, make sure they have soaked in water for 30 minutes to prevent them from burning. (If you score them with a sharp knife, bamboo skewers will easily break into smaller pieces that fit into the air fryer pan; I trimmed the fuzzy edges with a pair of kitchen shears.)</p>
<p>Preheat air fryer to 400 degrees.</p>
<p>Thread chicken cubes onto skewers, 6 or 7 pieces on each. Place in the air fryer and cook for 8 minutes. Using tongs or your fingers (the meat will be hot!), rotate the skewers and air fry again for another 8 minutes, until both sides are golden brown and internal temperature of chicken is 165 degrees on an instant-read thermometer.</p>
<p>Remove from air fryer to platter. Place one chicken skewer in each of the baguette pieces, and slide out the skewer. Top with pickled vegetables and a drizzle of reserved bang bang sauce.</p>
<p>Garnish with chopped chives or scallions, and chili flakes, if using, and serve.</p>
<p>Serves 4.</p>
