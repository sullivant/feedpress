An Israeli attack on a school used to shelter displaced Palestinians has killed at least 22 people, including 15 children, in central Gaza, officials say.

Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence Agency said the site in Nuseirat camp was struck by a volley of artillery on Sunday, killing entire families and wounding dozens more.

The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said it was looking into the reports.

Earlier, five children were reportedly killed by a drone strike while playing on a street corner in northern Gaza.

A civil defence spokesman said the attack on al-Mufti school, where hundreds of displaced people from around Gaza were sheltering, had injured at least 80 people and more than a dozen were killed.

The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said the school-turned-shelter was meant to be used to administer polio vaccines.

Monday's rollout is the second stage in the, which is where most residents are now living and where the first case of polio in two decades was recently discovered in an unvaccinated baby.

In a separate Israeli strike, four people were killed and dozens more injured at the al-Aqsa hospital in central Gaza. Israel said it carried out a "precise strike on terrorists who were operating inside a command and control centre" inside a site previously used as a hospital.

The main areas of conflict in Gaza in recent days have been in the north, where Israeli forces have been intensifying attacks for over a week as part of a major ground operation. Hundreds have since been killed, Gazan authorities have reported.

Residents of Beit Hanoun, Jabalia and Beit Lahiya have reported being cut off from nearby Gaza City, while Israeli tanks have been seen on the outskirts of the territory's largest city.

Hospitals in the area are running out of supplies, although theWorld Health Organization said a joint operation with the Red Cross had resupplied two of them -after nine days of attempts.

The five children in northern Gaza were reportedly killed in an Israeli air strike while playing on a street corner in al-Shati camp.

Graphic images from the scene in the aftermath show the bloodied bodies of what appeared to be young teenage boys.

One of them looked to be clutching several glass marbles in his hand.

According to a report from the scene, told to a BBC correspondent, a drone strike hit a person walking down the street, which killed the children and injured seven other people.

Later images showed the bodies of the five boys wrapped in white shrouds and laid out on the floor side-by-side.

An aunt of one of the boys, named Rami, wrote a moving tribute to him on social media. She said the family had moved to al-Shati after being forced to leave their homes in Jabalia to a “safer area” because of the war.

The IDF has not yet responded to questions about the incident.

Over the last year of war, the Hamas-run health ministry has reported more than 42,000 people killed. In the past 24 hours, at least 62 people have died and 220 more injured following four Israeli strikes, it added.

About 1.9 million of Gaza's 2.4 million people have been displaced by the war - many of whom have been forced to move multiple times to escape.

The fighting began after Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October last year - killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 200 hostage in Gaza.

Naumann shot Czeslaw Kukuczka in 1974 at Friedrichstrasse station, seen here in a modern photograph

A former East German secret police officer has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for murdering a Polish man attempting to flee to West Berlin 50 years ago.

The man, named as Martin Manfred N in court papers, is now 80. He shot Czeslaw Kukuczka in the back at Friedrichstrasse station in 1974, after he had entered the Polish embassy claiming to be carrying a bomb and demanding to be allowed to leave to democratic West Germany.

Details of the killing remained unknown for decades after the Stasi secret police shredded files relating to the case before communist East Germany reunified with the West in 1991.

Berlin prosecutors filed charges against him in 2023 after persistent investigations by historians and Polish authorities.

On 29 March 1974, 38-year-old Kukuczka, a firefighter, entered the Polish embassy on East Berlin's Unter den Linden boulevard with a briefcase.

The father of three said - falsely - that he was carrying a bomb. He demanded to be allowed to leave for West Berlin.

Stasi officers gave him an exit visa and some West German money and escorted him to Friedrichstrasse station, which was still served by trains from the western side of the city.

Kukuczka passed several border checks inside the station. However, before he could make it to the western part of the station, a man approached him from behind and shot him in the back.

A group of schoolchildren from Hesse in West Germany were among witnesses to the killing. One gave evidence at the trial that she had seen a man shoot Kukuczka before "people in uniform" sealed off the passage.

Details of the case were uncovered by historians, who tracked down related files in the Stasi archives. Documents linking Naumann to the killing, which had been shredded, were reconstituted using a purpose-built machine.

Kukuczka's family was never officially told of his fate. His ashes were sent to his wife some weeks after his murder.

The case was brought to trial after Poland issued a European arrest warrant for Naumann in 2021.

The trial has been seen as holding special historical significance in Germany, similarly to trials of surviving Holocaust perpetrators.

Martin Manfred N always insisted on his innocence. His lawyer has said there was no proof he carried out the killing.

East Germany was created from the parts of Germany occupied by the Soviet Union after the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945. It was a communist dictatorship, while West Germany - created from the American, British and French occupation zones - was a capitalist, democratic state.

In 1991, both countries reunified to form modern Germany.

Enterprise software giantand AI-focused startup CoreWeave announced plans to invest billions of dollars in the U.K., in a vote of confidence for Prime Minister Keir Starmer as he looks to attract foreign investment.

ServiceNow said it would invest $1.5 billion in the U.K. over the next five years, as it grows its U.K. business. The U.S.-based company plans to expand its U.K. presence with new office space and grow its staff base beyond the 1,000 people it currently employs.

ServiceNow also said it would invest the cash into localizing the processing of data for its large language models (LLMs), artificial intelligence models that rely on vast quantities of training data to be able to understand and generate text like a human.

The firm said it would bringGPUs (graphics processing units) to its data centers based in London and the Welsh city of Newport to support processing of data on its LLMs within the U.K. This will help support "domain specific LLMs" for U.K. clients and governments, ServiceNow said.

Policymakers and regulators in Europe have increasingly been calling for so-called AI sovereignty. This refers to the idea that the technologies and data underpinning advanced artificial intelligence systems should be stored within Europe, and more accurately reflect the culture and history of Europeans.

Cloud computing firm CoreWeave, meanwhile, which rents out expensive GPUs to developers looking to train and run large AI models, said it would invest £750 million ($978.6 million) to support U.K. demand for AI infrastructure — its second major investment in the country after announcing a £1 billion commitment in May.

Meanwhile, two U.S. data center operators also announced plans to invest billions in the U.K. One firm, CyrusOne, said it plans to expand its investment in the country to £2.5 billion over the coming years, while another, CloudHQ, committed to developing a new £1.9 billion data center campus in Didcot, Oxfordshire.

In total, the cloud infrastructure investments amount to £6.3 billion, according to the U.K. government.

"Today's drumbeat of investment is a vote of confidence in Britain and our approach to work with business to deliver sustained growth for all," U.K. Technology Minister Peter Kyle said in a statement Monday.

## Upskilling programs

ServiceNow said it also planned to offer new skills programs in the U.K. that will reach 240,000 people.

"The United Kingdom is embracing technology transformation at scale. In this new age of AI, the country continues to be a global leader in driving innovation for the benefit of all its communities," Bill McDermott, ServiceNow's CEO, said in a statement Monday.

"Our investment accelerates the U.K.'s push to put AI to work, empowering people, enriching experiences, and strengthening societal bonds. Together, ServiceNow and our customers across the U.K. are delivering a future where technology benefits everyone."

The announcements were made as part of the International Investment Summit, where U.K. leader Keir Starmer is set to gather 300 business leaders to encourage foreign investment.

ServiceNow, CoreWeave, CyrusOne and CloudHQ aren't the only U.S. tech firms betting big on the U.K. as a global destination for AI innovation. Earlier this year,opened itsin London, a space it's using to facilitate artificial intelligence training and upskilling programs as well as promote industry collaboration.

The AI center forms part of a $4 billion investment Salesforce committed to making in the U.K. over five years in June last year.

The European Central Bank is on course to deliver its third interest rate cut of the year at its meeting this Thursday, as policymakers say inflation risks are easing faster than previously expected.

Headline price rises in the euro area, below the central bank's 2% target. Core inflation, which strips out the more volatile components of energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, hit a two-and-a-half year low of 2.7%.

Those figures have broadly continued to fall even after the ECB cut interest rates by 25 basis points, and again by the same amount, with the central bank taking its key rate — the deposit facility — from a record high of 4% down to 3.5% across the two sessions.

As of Monday morning, money markets had priced in not only another 25-basis-point reduction during the October meeting, but also a follow-up cut to 3% at its next and final gathering of the year in December.

Expectations for faster monetary easing have built since the ECB's Sept. 12 meeting, amid a series of dovish comments from officials and cooler-than-expected inflation prints from euro area states,. Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhauan October rate cut as "very likely" and said such a step "won't be the last."

"Victory against inflation is in sight," Villeroy told radio station France Info, noting that some volatility and upticks in the headline rate could follow.

ECB President Christine Lagarde told European Union parliamentarians late last month that the latest developments had strengthened the central bank's "confidence that inflation will return to target in a timely manner," and said this would be taken into account in October. Analysts at Citi described this signal as a "pivot" away from Lagarde's Sept. 12 messaging, which suggested a "gradual approach" to rate cuts was more appropriate, given risks to the inflation outlook.

Even noted ECB hawk Joachim Nagel, head of Germany's Bundesbank,that the inflation trend was "good news" and that he was open to discussing another cut.

## Weak growth

Expectations of back-to-back cuts have also been raised by the, as well as by the tone set by the U.S. Federal Reserve's Sept. 18 decision to press ahead with.

"Clearly softer activity data and faster disinflation have had an immediate impact on both ECB communication and markets," Barclays strategists said in a note Sunday.

Composite purchasing managers' index figures, which measure services and manufacturing activity, point to stagnation in the third quarter, according to consultancy Capital Economics. That would followin the second quarter.

A flash reading for the third quarter will be released on Oct. 30.

Tight monetary policy is providing a drag on growth, in addition to structural issues such as the decline in German industrial competitiveness, Jack Allen-Reynolds, Capital Economics' deputy chief euro zone economist, said last week. This led him to forecast ECB rate cuts will take place both this week and at each of the central bank's forthcoming meetings, until the deposit rate hits 2.5%.

That outlook is also due to a cooling labor market and slower wage growth helping bring down services inflation in the months ahead, he added.

The ECB itself trimmed its annual euro zone growth forecast last month on the back of weaker domestic demand, now projecting an 0.8% GDP rise, compared with 0.9% previously.

## Adjustment in language

Economists at Bank of America Global Research said in a Sunday note that they expected the ECB to cut rates this week without making major changes to their guidance.

"In our view, this is the start of that accelerated trajectory to 2% [rates] by June 2025 and further to 1.5% by end-2025," they said.

"However, the ECB is very unlikely to communicate anything of the sort. The meeting-by-meeting approach and data dependence are likely to remain firmly in place, perhaps just sprinkled by (verbal) references to rising confidence that inflation is on track to return to target."

According to Berenberg Chief Economist Holger Schmieding, Lagarde is unlikely to correct market expectations for a December cut during her press conference on Thursday — thus locking the pricing in. Schmieding predicted that the ECB may have to lower its growth outlook for 2024 even further when it releases new staff projections in December.

However, he also cautioned that the central bank currently runs the risk of overreacting and easing monetary policy to far and too fast.

"Next year, inflation should not be a major issue... However, this will not hold for 2026 and 2027, in our view," he said in a Monday note.

Once the euro area's growth rate returns to normal in spring of next year, as the ECB expects, wage inflation will rebound, and more robust demand will allow companies to pass higher costs on to consumers, he argued.

"If the ECB lowers the deposit rate to well below 3% in 2025, it will probably have to raise it back to 3% in late 2026 or early 2027," Schmieding said.

Italian Prime Ministeris at the centre of a “snooping scandal” in which a bank branch employee at Italy’s biggest bank is alleged to have illegally accessed and “spied on” thousands of private accounts.

A clerk at Banca Intesa Sanpaolo has been accused of gaining unauthorised access to more than 3,500 accounts belonging to politicians, businesspeople, celebrities and athletes, violating privacy laws and threatening national security.

The bank clerk, Vincenzo Coviello, 52, said he was motivated by “curiosity” and was frustrated in his career. He told authorities he did not keep a record of the bank activity he had access to – which reveals the client’s whereabouts and other sensitive data – and denied sharing the information with anyone.

Meloni, however, has turned the incident into a national scandal, saying “pressure groups” seeking to drive her from office and to interfere with democracy were really behind Coviello’s actions.

So what really happened?
## How were the accounts accessed and who did they belong to?

Coviello, a clerk at a branch in Bisceglie in the Apulia region of southern Italy, began his alleged spying activity in February 2022. For more than two years, he illegally accessed clients’ personal accounts 6,976 times, according to a police investigation.

His targets allegedly included Meloni; her sister Arianna, the coordinator of the secretariat of the governing party,; and the prime minister’s former partner Andrea Giambruno.

The long list of politicians whose accounts were accessed also includes Defence Minister Guido Crosetto, Minister for European Affairs Raffaele Fitto, Tourism Minister Daniela Santanche and President of the Senate Ignazio La Russa.

Coviello is accused of also spying on the financial affairs of the heirs of deceased Italian businessman and former Prime Ministeras well as businessman Lapo Elkann, former footballer Francesco Totti and singer Al Bano.
## What sort of information was accessed and what was done with it?

Coviello’s position within the bank gave him access to clients’ information, including the times and locations of cash withdrawals, online and card payments, and bank transfers.

The information obtained is sensitive and could be used to gain knowledge of a person’s whereabouts, contacts, business dealings, properties and debts.

This sort of information could have been downloaded, saved and sold on to business competitors, political opponents or a wide array of fraudsters looking to blackmail or otherwise intimidate politicians and celebrities. The dark web is one of the avenues investigators are still looking at to find out if any of the information was, in fact, sold.

However, Coviello has denied saving and sharing the information, arguing instead that he acted in the grip of a “psychological compulsion” for which he had sought professional help.

It is not yet clear whether the information was sold or otherwise divulged.
## Is there a police investigation?

Prosecutors in Bari have opened an investigation. The clerk has been accused of violating privacy laws and threatening national security with unidentified accomplices.

Roberto Rossi, the prosecutor in Bari, said Coviello most likely acted with another person who commissioned him to access the files.

However, the clerk maintains that he acted alone. Italy’s Carabinieri police are combing through his finances to determine whether he has received any payments.

Coviello was fired from his post in August after Banca Intesa Sanpaolo launched an internal disciplinary action that uncovered evidence of his alleged illicit activity.
## Why does Meloni say this is part of a larger plot to drive her from office?

Meloni charges that the snooping was an attempt to undermine her government, but the ongoing investigation has so far not produced any evidence to back up her claim.

“The pressure groups don’t accept having someone in government who doesn’t bend to pressure and can’t be blackmailed, so perhaps they try to get rid of them by other means,” she told the TG5 news bulletin. “But I’m afraid they won’t succeed in getting rid of me.”

The leader of the right-wing Brothers of Italy party said the politicians whose accounts were accessed were nearly all from her side of the political spectrum.

It is unclear if this was the case. Italian media reported that the search queries operated by the clerk appeared to be random and had targeted the accounts of people from across the political spectrum.

This is not the first incident that Meloni claims is part of a wider plot to oust her.

This year, Antonio Laudati, a magistrate, and Pasquale Striano – an officer in the finance police, the Guardia di Finanza, which is an Italian law enforcement agency that answers to the economy and finance minister – were found to have accessed files from the Anti-Mafia Investigative Directorate on the prime minister and members of her government with no prior authorisation.

The motives behind Laudati and Striano’s move are being investigated.

Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi said these incidents raised the “strong suspicion of an attempt to alter the course of democracy”, but no such plot has been uncovered so far."""
