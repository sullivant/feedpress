An Israeli attack on a school used to shelter displaced Palestinians has killed at least 22 people, including 15 children, in central Gaza, officials say.

Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence Agency said the site in Nuseirat camp was struck by a volley of artillery on Sunday, killing entire families and wounding dozens more.

The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said it was looking into the reports.

Earlier, five children were reportedly killed by a drone strike while playing on a street corner in northern Gaza.

A civil defence spokesman said the attack on al-Mufti school, where hundreds of displaced people from around Gaza were sheltering, had injured at least 80 people and more than a dozen were killed.

The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said the school-turned-shelter was meant to be used to administer polio vaccines.

Monday's rollout is the second stage in the, which is where most residents are now living and where the first case of polio in two decades was recently discovered in an unvaccinated baby.

In a separate Israeli strike, four people were killed and dozens more injured at the al-Aqsa hospital in central Gaza. Israel said it carried out a "precise strike on terrorists who were operating inside a command and control centre" inside a site previously used as a hospital.

The main areas of conflict in Gaza in recent days have been in the north, where Israeli forces have been intensifying attacks for over a week as part of a major ground operation. Hundreds have since been killed, Gazan authorities have reported.

Residents of Beit Hanoun, Jabalia and Beit Lahiya have reported being cut off from nearby Gaza City, while Israeli tanks have been seen on the outskirts of the territory's largest city.

Hospitals in the area are running out of supplies, although theWorld Health Organization said a joint operation with the Red Cross had resupplied two of them -after nine days of attempts.

The five children in northern Gaza were reportedly killed in an Israeli air strike while playing on a street corner in al-Shati camp.

Graphic images from the scene in the aftermath show the bloodied bodies of what appeared to be young teenage boys.

One of them looked to be clutching several glass marbles in his hand.

According to a report from the scene, told to a BBC correspondent, a drone strike hit a person walking down the street, which killed the children and injured seven other people.

Later images showed the bodies of the five boys wrapped in white shrouds and laid out on the floor side-by-side.

An aunt of one of the boys, named Rami, wrote a moving tribute to him on social media. She said the family had moved to al-Shati after being forced to leave their homes in Jabalia to a “safer area” because of the war.

The IDF has not yet responded to questions about the incident.

Over the last year of war, the Hamas-run health ministry has reported more than 42,000 people killed. In the past 24 hours, at least 62 people have died and 220 more injured following four Israeli strikes, it added.

About 1.9 million of Gaza's 2.4 million people have been displaced by the war - many of whom have been forced to move multiple times to escape.

The fighting began after Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October last year - killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 200 hostage in Gaza.

A spacecraft that will hunt for signs of alien life on one of Jupiter’s icy moons has blasted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida.

Nasa launched the spacecraft at 12:06 local time (16:06 GMT) after hurricane Milton forced the mission to postpone plans last week.

Europa Clipper will now travel 1.8 billion miles to reach Europa, a deeply mysterious moon orbiting Jupiter.

It will not arrive until 2030 but what it finds could change what we know about life in our solar system.

Trapped under the moon’s surface could be a vast ocean with double the amount of water on Earth.

The spacecraft is chasing a European mission that left last year, but using a cosmic piggyback, it will overtake and arrive first.

## A moon five times brighter than ours

Years in the making, the Europa Clipper launch was delayed at the last minute after hurricane Milton blasted Florida this week.

The spacecraft was rushed indoors for shelter, but after checking the launchpad at Cape Canaveral for damage, engineers have now given the go-ahead for lift-off at 12:06 local time (16:06 GMT).

“If we discover life so far away from the Sun, it would imply a separate origin of life to the Earth,” says Mark Fox-Powell, a planetary microbiologist at the Open University.

“That is hugely significant, because if that happens twice in our solar system, it could mean life is really common,” he says.

Located 628 million kilometres from Earth, Europa is just a bit bigger than our moon, but that is where the similarity ends.

If it was in our skies, it would shine five times brighter because the water ice would reflect much more sunlight.

Its icy crust is up to 25km thick, and sloshing beneath, there could be a vast saltwater ocean. There may also be chemicals that are the ingredients for simple life.

The spacecraft is just longer than a professional basketball court and weighs around the same as an African elephant

Scientists first realised Europa might support life in the 1970s when, peering through a telescope in Arizona, they saw water ice.

Voyager 1 and 2 spacecrafts captured the first close-up images, and then in 1995 Nasa’s Galileo spacecraft flew past Europa taking some deeply puzzling pictures. They showed a surface riddled with dark, reddish-brown cracks, fractures that may contain salts and sulfur compounds that could support life.

The Hubble space telescope has since taken pictures of what might be plumes of water ejected 100 miles (160 kilometers) above the moon’s surface

But none of those missions got close enough to Europa for long enough to really understand it.

## Flying through plumes of water

Now scientists hope that instruments on Nasa’s Clipper spacecraft will map almost the entire moon, as well as collect dust particles and fly through the water plumes.

Britney Schmidt, professor of earth and atmospheric sciences at Cornell university in the US, helped to design a laser onboard that will see through the ice.

“I'm most excited about understanding Europa’s plumbing. Where's the water? Europa has the ice version of Earth’s subduction zones, magma chambers and tectonics - we’re going to try to see into those regions and map them,” she says.

Her instrument, which is called Reason, was tested in Antarctica.

But unlike on Earth, all the instruments on Clipper will be exposed to huge amounts of radiation which Prof Schmidt says is a “major concern.”

The spacecraft should fly past Europa about 50 times, and each time, it will be blasted with radiation equivalent to one million X-rays.

“Much of the electronics are in a vault that's heavily shielded to keep out radiation,” Prof Schmidt explains.

The spaceship is the largest ever built to visit a planet and has a long journey ahead. Travelling 1.8 billion miles, it will orbit both the Earth and Mars to propel itself further towards Jupiter in what is called the sling-shot effect.

Europa Clipper will travel for five and a half years to reach Jupiter

It cannot carry enough fuel to motor itself all the way alone, so it will piggyback off the momentum of Earth and Mars’s gravitational pull.

It will overtake JUICE, the European Space Agency’s spaceship that will also visit Europa on its way to another of Jupiter’s moons called Ganeymede.

Once Clipper approaches Europa in 2030 it will switch on its engines again to carefully manoeuvre itself into the right orbit.

Space scientists are very cautious when talking about the chances of discovering life - there is no expectation that they will find human-like creatures or animals.

“We are searching for the potential for habitability and you need four things - liquid water, a heat source, and organic material. Finally those three ingredients need to be stable over a long enough period of time that something can happen,” explains Michelle Dougherty, professor of space physics at Imperial College in London.

And they hope that if they can understand the ice surface better, they will know where to land a craft on a future mission.

An international team of scientists with Nasa, the Jet Propulsion Lab and the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab will oversee the odyssey.

At a time when there is a space launch virtually every week, this mission promises something different, suggests Professor Fox-Powell.

“There's no profit being made. This is about exploration and curiosity, and pushing back the boundaries of our knowledge of our place in the universe,” he says.

Enterprise software giantand AI-focused startup CoreWeave announced plans to invest billions of dollars in the U.K., in a vote of confidence for Prime Minister Keir Starmer as he looks to attract foreign investment.

ServiceNow said it would invest $1.5 billion in the U.K. over the next five years, as it grows its U.K. business. The U.S.-based company plans to expand its U.K. presence with new office space and grow its staff base beyond the 1,000 people it currently employs.

ServiceNow also said it would invest the cash into localizing the processing of data for its large language models (LLMs), artificial intelligence models that rely on vast quantities of training data to be able to understand and generate text like a human.

The firm said it would bringGPUs (graphics processing units) to its data centers based in London and the Welsh city of Newport to support processing of data on its LLMs within the U.K. This will help support "domain specific LLMs" for U.K. clients and governments, ServiceNow said.

Policymakers and regulators in Europe have increasingly been calling for so-called AI sovereignty. This refers to the idea that the technologies and data underpinning advanced artificial intelligence systems should be stored within Europe, and more accurately reflect the culture and history of Europeans.

Cloud computing firm CoreWeave, meanwhile, which rents out expensive GPUs to developers looking to train and run large AI models, said it would invest £750 million ($978.6 million) to support U.K. demand for AI infrastructure — its second major investment in the country after announcing a £1 billion commitment in May.

Meanwhile, two U.S. data center operators also announced plans to invest billions in the U.K. One firm, CyrusOne, said it plans to expand its investment in the country to £2.5 billion over the coming years, while another, CloudHQ, committed to developing a new £1.9 billion data center campus in Didcot, Oxfordshire.

In total, the cloud infrastructure investments amount to £6.3 billion, according to the U.K. government.

"Today's drumbeat of investment is a vote of confidence in Britain and our approach to work with business to deliver sustained growth for all," U.K. Technology Minister Peter Kyle said in a statement Monday.

## Upskilling programs

ServiceNow said it also planned to offer new skills programs in the U.K. that will reach 240,000 people.

"The United Kingdom is embracing technology transformation at scale. In this new age of AI, the country continues to be a global leader in driving innovation for the benefit of all its communities," Bill McDermott, ServiceNow's CEO, said in a statement Monday.

"Our investment accelerates the U.K.'s push to put AI to work, empowering people, enriching experiences, and strengthening societal bonds. Together, ServiceNow and our customers across the U.K. are delivering a future where technology benefits everyone."

The announcements were made as part of the International Investment Summit, where U.K. leader Keir Starmer is set to gather 300 business leaders to encourage foreign investment.

ServiceNow, CoreWeave, CyrusOne and CloudHQ aren't the only U.S. tech firms betting big on the U.K. as a global destination for AI innovation. Earlier this year,opened itsin London, a space it's using to facilitate artificial intelligence training and upskilling programs as well as promote industry collaboration.

The AI center forms part of a $4 billion investment Salesforce committed to making in the U.K. over five years in June last year.

LONDON — The U.K.'s business minister said Monday that securing trade deals with India and Gulf nations remains "the priority" for the Labour government, with talks between Britain and the Gulf Corporation Council expected to resume as soon as next week.

U.K. Business and Trade Minister Jonathan Reynolds told CNBC that negotiations with a six-strong group of Gulf countries would reconvene "very soon — maybe as soon as next week," while talks with India also remain a priority.

"The Gulf and India are the priority," Reynolds said at the U.K.'s International Investment Summit at London's Guildhall. "I think there are clear economic and commercial reasons why we should pursue those," he said.

U.K. free trade deals were touted as a key benefit of Brexit, with former Prime Minister and Brexiteer Boris Johnson vowing to secure one with India "by Diwali" 2022. But they have so far proven elusive. Deals with Australia, New Zealand and Singapore are among the fewso far.

Shortly after taking office in July, Reynolds committed to continuing the work of the former Conservative government in this regard, and last month hethe Gulf for initial talks with the GCC, whose members include Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.

The trade minister has also previously said that the government was pursuing trade talks with Israel, South Korea, Switzerland and Turkey.

Reynolds would not commit on Monday to a time frame for the deals, saying the government's initial role was to "re-establish the authority for those trade talks" and expand on the work of his predecessors.

"When people say a deal is half done, obviously the easy bits are done first, so it's not necessarily an easy thing to explain the timescale on," he said.

However, he insisted that the deals were critical to the U.K., both economically and diplomatically.

"It's important to recognize, whilst we don't do foreign policy through trade deals, British engagement commercially – country to country, business to business – is in itself a good thing," he said.

"And even where those countries are not democracies like ours, it's a very positive relationship to encourage. It's not just commercial in terms of the benefits that come from those," Reynolds added.

U.K.-India trade talks, now entering their 15th round, could also resume as soon as this month, local media cited India's Commerce Secretary Sunil Barthwal aslast month.

Speaking to CNBC's Tanvir Gill in September, India's Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal said that both parties were keen to conclude a deal soon but that it would happen "systematically."

"A trade deal is never done with a gun on the head, either to U.K. or to India," Goyal said.

"We have to protect national interests and sensitivities on both sides, and therefore treaties have to be carefully calibrated to make them fair, equitable, balanced, meeting the interests of both nations, recognizing the future different positions that each partner will have in the future."

Last academic year saw university students across North American campuses form Gaza solidarity encampments to protest Israel’sof Palestinians and their universities’ financial complicity in the carnage. The sit-ins received widespread media coverage and helped carry Israel’s crimes against Palestinians to the top of the Western news agenda.

Although these campus protests were overwhelmingly peaceful and included many anti-Zionist Jewish students and faculty, Israel’s supporters in media, politics and academia itself responded to the demonstrations by accusing protesters of peddling anti-Semitism and intimidating Jewish students. Towards the end of the academic year, police dismantled most of these campus protests, arresting hundreds of students in the process and charging them with crimes ranging from third-degree trespass to felony burglary.

Now, as a new academic year starts and Zionist genocidalcontinues in Gaza, the West Bank and Lebanon students are once again mobilising in protest. These student protesters are already facing further intimidation from university administrations, threats from political leaders, abuse from the police and unsubstantiated accusations of anti-Semitism from mainstream media. Moreover, campuses this academic year are facing a new threat: intimidation from so-called Zionist “self-defence” groups with far-right links.

At the University of Toronto,(Defender of Freedom Canada), a volunteer-based Zionist vigilante group affiliated with Herut Canada – an organisation tied to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s far-right, revisionist Likud Party, which advocates for the “Greater Israel” settler-colonial vision – was mobilised to ostensibly “defend” Jewish students from what they claim to be protesters’ anti-Semitism.

Magen Herut plans to expand its “volunteer safety patrols” across Canada and into the United States. Membership requires ideological alignment with Zionism and experience in policing, security, or the military. With more than 50 members, Magen Herut coordinates through WhatsApp groups to patrol up to 15 zones, including university campuses, and to appear at Gaza solidarity protests, where they intimidate attendees. They go on patrol in sizeable groups, wearing black T-shirts that identify them as members of the Magen Herut “Surveillance team”. The group’s leader, Aaron Hadida, a security expert, teaches “Jewish self-defence,” including the use of firearms. Magen Herut works closely with J-Force, a private security firm that provides “protest security” for Israel supporters. J-Force deploys volunteers to pro-Palestine events in tactical gear. Both groups are expected to remain active on campus throughout the academic year.

Zionist activists with the Jewish Defense League (JDL), a Southern Poverty Law Center designated hate group whose stated goal is to “protect Jews from anti-Semitism by any means necessary”,have also been spotted at pro-Palestinian events at the university. The group, which was largely inactive prior to October 7, was deemed a “right-wing terrorist group” by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI),

Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that several “counter-protesters” waved flags with the JDL or the Kahane Chai symbol on them at a small pro-Palestine march at the University of Toronto on September 6. Kahane Chai is a fascistic Israeli group tied to JDL, which advocates for the forced expulsion of Arabs from Israel. Other participants in the Zionist action, the newspaper said, were seen wearing Kahane Chai caps and shouting chants calling for violence against Muslims and Palestinians, including “Let’s turn Gaza into a parking lot.”

The JDL has a long history of racist violence and terrorism. Its members bombed Arab and Soviet properties in the US and assassinated those it labelled “enemies of the Jewish people”, focusing on. They were linked to1985 bombings, one of which killed West Coast Regional Director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee Alex Odeh; the 1994when 29 worshippers were fatally shot in a Hebron mosque during Ramadan; and a 2001targeting US Representative Darrell Issa in his San Clemente, California district office and the King Fahad Mosque in Culver City, California.

The presence of uniformed far-right Zionist “patrol teams” and JDL flags at the University of Toronto is alarming. It means that persecutory tactics long used by Zionists to curb anti-colonial resistance in Palestine and elsewhere are now being imported into North American university campuses, which in the past year became epicentres of anti-Zionist resistance and solidarity between anti-colonial movements in the West.

The aim of these Zionist groups is twofold: fracture, weaken and defame intersectional resistance to, which of course includes Zionism, and provide support for US-led Western imperial expansionism and genocide, spearheaded by Israel.

To divert attention away from their far-right ties, fascist roots and blatant aggression against anti-genocide student protesters, the Zionist vigilantes active at the University of Toronto duplicitously frame themselves as Jewish “self-defence” forces.

The concept of “self-defence” has vastly different meanings for the colonised and the coloniser. For the colonised, “self” is tied to cultural identity, ancestral land and vital resources. Whereas for the coloniser, it is grounded in a constructed identity, land theft and the protection of stolen resources along with shifting blame for resistance to colonisation onto the colonised victims. Indeed, the leading Zionist militia from 1920 through the 1940s, the precursor of the “Israel Defence Force”, was named Haganah, meaning “defence” in Hebrew, and was a major force in appropriating Palestinian land and ridding it of its native population.

Zionist vigilante groups like the JDL employ the same “” rhetoric andused in Palestine since 1948 to justify offensive aggression and colonisation while appropriating Jewish victimhood and conflating it with Zionist criminality. They invoke fear in order to produce subservience and support for their eliminatory agenda. These groups rely on the concepts of deterrence and dehumanisation of Palestinians to justify extreme measures, framing their actions as defensive, thus obfuscating the potential illegality that comes with offensive aggression whilst responding to perceived threats with lethal force.

Zionist vigilante groups on Northern American university campuses target anti-genocide protesters under the guise of “Jewish defence” as a means of defendingand American forms and fracturing anti-colonial resistance led by Palestinian, Black, brown, Indigenous, immigrant and Jewish anti-Zionists.

In contrast, the anti-colonial alliance, both in North America and globally, is built on a shared understanding that white supremacist oppression is entrenched in systemic racism, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism and imperialism. By presenting a united front against all forms of racism and capitalism, it challenges the colonial and neocolonial establishments. As part of this resistance, it rejects Zionism as a white supremacist, European-driven project, drawing parallels to other manifest destiny ideologies that have fuelled Western settler-colonial ventures, including in the US.

Regardless of the outcome of the, white supremacy, Islamophobia and anti-Semitism continue to rise across North America. Additionally, the election discourse risks diverting attention from the threats posed by the increasing presence of Zionist groups with direct ties to far-right violence. To challenge it, people, including Jews, must stand against all forms of ethnocentrism and exclusion. The Jewish community’s long history of trauma and persecution should inspire a unified pursuit of justice, freedom and equality for everyone, rejecting Zionist vigilante terrorism.
