People are now fleeing on foot into Syria after an Israeli strike created a huge crater in the road

An Israeli air strike has hit near the main border crossing point for people fleeing the escalating bombing and ground campaign in Lebanon for neighbouring Syria.

Israel's military said it had hit Hezbollah targets near the Masnaa crossing, and earlier claimed the group was using it to smuggle weapons into Lebanon.

The strike on Friday destroyed a section of the road and effectively cut off vehicle access.

People are still able to make the journey on foot, with pictures showing families clambering over rubble and scrambling through the four-metre crater in the road to get out of the country.

More than 300,000 people have left Lebanon for Syria in the past 10 days to flee the bombing, according to Lebanese government figures.

The strike on Friday hit the road 700m from the checkpoint on the Lebanese side, and around 5km (3.1 miles) from the border itself.

Aid workers said the destruction of the road near Masnaa crossing hinders both the movement of people and also food and humanitarian supplies.

"It will mean that goods which would normally come overland through that crossing - the cheapest, most effective way to bring commodities into that country - will also not be able to be received here," Matthew Hollingworth, the director of the UN's World Food programme, told the BBC.

Mr Hollingworth stressed that it was essential for other routes leading out of Lebanon - particularly those in the north - to remain unhindered.

"We really would press that they remain open because they will be critical for people to leave, and also for humanitarian commodities to come in," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

The Masnaa crossing in Lebanon's east had been the main path for people to move into Syria, and then onto Jordan and the Gulf States, while in Lebanon the road had also connected west to the capital Beirut on the coast, which has been heavily bombed in recent days.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Friday said it had targeted a site at the border crossing where "weapons were transferred to Hezbollah", and also a 3.5km underground tunnel between Lebanon and Syria, the location of which was not specified.

In a statement issued before the strike, the IDF said the crossing had become the "primary border crossing for Hezbollah's weapons transfers" and accused the group of concealing "smuggling activity among civilian trucks and vehicles". It called on Lebanon to thoroughly inspect trucks.

Many people moving east are Syrian nationals living in Lebanon, who have headed back to their own country to escape Israel's bombardments.

"I found a lot of people from our neighbourhood heading for Syria, so I sent him with them," she said.

Syria's government said on Sunday that for the next week people crossing the border would no longer have to pay $100 to enter the country.

On Friday,, the Beirut-Rafic Hariri International Airport. The airport borders the suburb of Dahieh, Hezbollah's stronghold in the city, and a continued target of Israeli air strikes.

Major strikes there one week ago killed the long-time leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah. Reports indicated that the new strikes on Friday morning were aimed at the group's new leadership, including a potential new overall leader, Hashem Safieddine.

Lebanon's public health ministry said 37 people had been killed in ground and air attacks on Thursday while 151 others had been wounded.

More than 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon by Israeli air strikes since fighting escalated just over two weeks ago, the Lebanese health ministry says.

Israeli forces on Friday also told residents of another two dozen towns and villages in the South, including the regional capital city of Nabatieh, to leave immediately for their safety.

The new order applies to communities further inland, north of the Litani river, about 30km from the border with Israel.

The river is a crucial marker as Israel has previously demanded that Hezbollah withdraw to the Litani, as per the UN Security Council resolution that ended their last war in 2006. But there are concerns in Lebanon that Israel will seek to occupy part of the country's south again.

The area worst hit by flash floods and landslides was around Jablanica

Flash floods and landslides in central Bosnia-Herzegovina have left at least 18 people dead, with towns and villages cut off and reports in some places of homes being almost submerged.

Some of the worst scenes were in the area around Jablanica, a town on the main route between the cities of Mostar and the capital, Sarajevo, about 70km (40 miles) to the north-east.

A number of other people have been reported missing and a state of emergency has been declared.

Development minister Vojin Mijatovic said the country had witnessed a terrible disaster and appealed for calm.

A 200m (650ft) section of track was left hanging in the air because of a landslide

Rivers burst their banks after an overnight storm and aerial photos showed many towns and villages left inundated.

Roads, bridges and railway tracks were washed away or blocked by debris, while landslides left houses buried in rocks and earth as high as their upper storeys.

The main M-17 route, which runs alongside the River Neretva was covered in debris close to Jablanica and a 17km-stretch of railway was badly damaged between nearby Ostrozac and Grabovica to the west. One 200m stretch of track was left hanging in the air by a landslide close to the river south of Jablanica.

The local authority in Herzegovina-Neretva Canton warned drivers to avoid dangerous roads around Jablanica.

Further east along the Neretva river, one homeowner told Bosnian media that water had flooded house at 03:30 on Friday and that they barely managed to save their son before escaping to neighbours and seeing their house collapse.

Meanwhile, 20km to the west of the capital around around Kiseljak, a torrent of water flooded the streets, leaving cars submerged.

The flooding was not confined to Bosnia. In neighbouring Montenegro, roads were washed away leaving the village of Komarnica cut off.

Water levels were also rising in some of Croatia's rivers, and the government in Zagreb said there was a risk of some areas in the city of Karlovac being flooded close the Kupa river.

Much of Central Europe was hit by floods last month, with some of the worst devastation in Poland, the Czech Republic and Romania.

Scientists from the World Weather Attribution (WWA) group said one four-day period had been the rainiest ever recorded in the region. They said the floods had been made much worse by climate change.

Europe is the fastest-warming continent. The last five years were on average around 2.3C warmer than the second half of the 19th Century, according to the Copernicus climate service.

Shares of French video game publishersurged more than 30% on Friday after a media report thatand the firm's founding Guillemot family are considering a potential buyout of the company.

Friday that Tencent and the Guillemot family, which are both minority shareholders of Ubisoft, are considering a buyout among other options after the company lost more than half its market value this year.

One possibility currently being discussed is a combination of Tencent and the Guillemot family partnering up to take the company private, the business news agency reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

Shares of Ubisoft spiked 33.5% by the market close Friday following publication of the report.

Ubisoft declined to comment on the Bloomberg News report. Tencent was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC Friday.

The European gaming giant, which is most known for its popular "Assassin's Creed" franchise, has been in a state of uncertainty lately amid investor concerns over its lackluster triple-A games pipeline and the overall management of the company.

Last week, Ubisoft said it was postponing the release of the next title in its popular games series, "Assassin's Creed Shadows," by three months to Feb. 14, 2025, after "softer than expected" demand for the firm's "Star Wars Outlaws" game, which launched in August.

Ubisoft also cut its net bookings guidance for its 2025 fiscal year to around 1.95 billion euros, below the 2.32 billion euros Ubisoft reported for its 2024 fiscal year.

Tencent, which owns a, is one of China's largest technology firms. The company, best known in China for its strong market share in gaming, is behind the Chinese multiplayer online battle arena game "Honor of Kings" which it publishes under its TiMi Studio Group publisher arm.

## Activist pressure

Speculation over a potential takeover comes as. Last week, AJ Investments, an activist investor with a less than 1% stake in Ubisoft, said it had amassed the support of 10% of Ubisoft's shareholder base to push for changes at the company.

In an open letter last Thursday, the private equity firm said it had engaged "industry experts" as potential replacements for the current Ubisoft management to realize a turnaround strategy at Ubisoft. It called for Ubisoft to sell itself to private equity groups or Tencent.

Following Ubisoft's guidance cut and a performance in the second quarter that "fell short" of the company's expectations, CEO Yves Guillemot announced that the firm's executive committee would launch a review to "further improve" execution.

Along with delays to its premier title, Ubisoft is also grappling with a games industry-wide slump. The global games market is, according to research firm Newzoo — no where near the surging growth levels witnessed during the 2020 and 2021 Covid-19 pandemic years.

James Lockyer, technology research analyst at U.K. investment bank Peel Hunt, told CNBC earlier this week that part of the problem for game publishers today is that gamers are devoting more of their time to older games than to newer titles.

"More choice plus a cost-of-living squeezed wallet has meant consumers' cash has been spread more thinly, leading to revenues and ROIs [return on investment] of those games often coming out below expectations," Lockyer told CNBC via email.

September's outsized payrolls boost takes the U.S. economy out of the shadows of recession and gives the Federal Reserve a fairly open glide path to a soft landing.

If that sounds like a Goldilocks scenario, it's probably not far from it, even with the lingering inflation concerns that are straining consumers' wallets.

A gravity-defying jobs market, at least a slowing pace of price increases and declining interest rates puts the macro picture in a pretty good place right now — a critical time from a policy and political standpoint.

"We've been expecting a soft landing. This just gives us more confidence that it seems to remain in place," Beth Ann Bovino, chief economist at U.S. Bank, said after Friday's nonfarm payrolls report. "It also increases the possibility of a no-landing as well, meaning even stronger economic data for 2025 than we currently expect."

The jobs count certainly was better than virtually anyone figured, with companies and the government combining to, blowing away the Dow Jones consensus for 150,000. It was a big step up even from August's upwardly revised numbers and reversed a trend that started in April of decelerating job numbers and rising concern for a broader slowdown — or worse.

Beyond that, it virtually eliminated any chance that the Federal Reserve would be repeating itsfrom September anytime soon.

In fact, futures markets reversed positioning after the report, pricing in a near-certain probability of just a quarter-point move at the November Fed meeting, followed by another quarter point in December, according to the CME Group'sgauge. Prior, markets had been looking for a half-point in December followed by the equivalent of quarter-point cuts at each of the eight Federal Open Market Committee meetings in 2025.

## Not a perfect picture

No more, though, as the Fed, barring any more disappointments from the labor market, can stake a moderate pace through its easing cycle.

"If we continue to see a stronger than expected economy that may give the Fed reasons to slow the pace of rate cuts through 2025 with that exit rate being a little bit higher than they currently expect, all with the economy still maintaining its strength," Bovino said. "That would be good news for both the Fed and the economy."

To be sure, there remain some blemishes in the jobs picture.

More than 60% of the growth for September came from the usual suspects — food and drinking establishments, health care and government — that have all been the beneficiaries of fiscal largesse that has pushed the 2024 budget deficit to the brink of $2 trillion.

There also were a few technical factors with the report, such as a low response rate from survey participants, that could cast some clouds over Friday's sunny report and lead toin subsequent months.

But broadly speaking, the news was very good and raised questions over just how aggressive the Fed will need to be.

## Questions for the Fed

Bank of America economists, for instance, asked "Did the Fed panic?" in a client note referencing the half percentage point, or 50 basis point, cut in September, while others wondered about the wild vacillations and miscalculations among Wall Street experts. David Royal, chief financial and investment officer at financial services firm Thrivent, speculated that "it is doubtful" the Fed would have cut by so much "if it had known this report would be so strong."

"The question becomes, how does everybody keep getting it wrong?" said Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab. "How is it we can't get this number right with all the information we get?"

Jones said the Fed will have a dilemma on its hand as it figures out the proper policy response. The FOMC next meets Nov. 6-7, right after the U.S. presidential election and following a five-week span during which it will get plenty more to digest.

Some commentary after the meeting suggested the Fed may have to raise its estimate of the "neutral" rate of interest that neither boosts nor restricts growth, an indication that benchmark interest rates will settle at a higher place than they have in the recent past.

"What does the Fed do with this? Certainly, 50 basis points is off the table for the next meeting. I don't think there's any case to be made there," Jones said. "Do they pause? Do they do another 25 [basis points] because they're still far from neutral? Do they just weigh this against other data that might not be as strong? I think they have a lot of figuring out to do."

In the meantime, though, officials are likely to be content knowing that the economy is stable, the labor market isn't in nearly as much trouble as had been suspected, and they have time to weigh their next move.

"We've witnessed a pretty remarkable economy over the past few years, despite some naysayers and lackluster consumer sentiment," said Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet. "In an election year, passions run high and every economic report or event can garner intense reaction. But the economic aggregates tell us the U.S. economy has been and is strong."

*Morocco slams ECJ ruling that said the people of Western Sahara were not consulted before the 2019 deals were signed.*

The European Union’s top court has confirmed an earlier ruling cancelling trade deals that allow Morocco to export fish and farm products to the EU from the disputed Western Sahara region, a move Morocco slammed as “blatant political bias”.

The European Court of Justice (ECJ) on Friday ruled that the European Commission breached the right of people in Western Sahara to self-determination by concluding trade deals with Morocco.

The Commission said it would examine the ECJ judgement in detail, while Morocco condemned it.

The ruling contained legal errors and “suspicious factual mistakes”, Morocco’s foreign ministry said in a statement, urging the European Council, the Commission and member states to uphold their commitments and preserve the assets of the partnership with Morocco.

Western Sahara, a tract of desert the size of Britain, has been the scene of Africa’s longest-running territorial dispute since colonial power Spain left in 1975 and Morocco annexed the territory.

The Algerian-backed Polisario Front, which seeks an independent state in Western Sahara, hailed the verdict as an “historic victory” for the area’s Sahrawi people.

Friday’s decision is the final ruling after several appeals by the Commission, the EU’s executive arm. The bloc signed fishing and agriculture agreements with Morocco in 2019 that also covered products from the Western Sahara.

“The consent of the people of Western Sahara to the implementation … is a condition for the validity of the decisions by which the [EU] Council approved those agreements on behalf of the European Union,” the court said.

It said a consultation process that took place had not involved “the people of Western Sahara but the inhabitants who are currently present in that territory, irrespective of whether or not they belong to the people of Western Sahara”.

The court also ruled that melons and tomatoes produced in Western Sahara must now have their origin labelled as such.

“Labelling must indicate Western Sahara alone as the country of origin of those goods, to the exclusion of any reference to Morocco, so as to avoid misleading consumers,” it said.
## ‘Historic victory’

EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said the European Commission was analysing the ruling and reiterated that the bloc highly valued its “long-standing, wide-ranging and deep” strategic partnership with Morocco.

“The EU firmly intends to preserve and continue strengthening close relations with Morocco,” she said in a joint statement with EU foreign affairs boss Josep Borrell.

Welcoming the ECJ ruling, Oubi Bouchraya, the Polisario’s representative to the United Nations in Switzerland, said, “It is a historic victory for the Sahrawi people that confirms the wrongdoings of the EU and Morocco and confirms the permanent sovereignty of the Sahrawi people over their natural resources,” the Reuters news agency reported.

“It is the most eloquent response to the last unilateral position of France and others,” Bouchraya added.

Western powers, including the United States in 2020, and most recently France, have backed Morocco’s sovereignty over the territory, angering Algeria.

Thousands of Sahrawi refugees have been stuck in limbo, living in desert camps in Tindouf, Algeria.

The UN brokered a ceasefire in 1991 ending a war between Morocco and the Polisario, but failed to organise a referendum due to disagreements about who should vote.

In its recent resolutions, the UN Security Council has urged the parties to seek a mutually acceptable political solution to the conflict.

*The ‘real time PCR test’ will enable the detection of the virus by swabbing human skin lesions.*

The World Health Organization (WHO) has approved the use of the first diagnostic test forthat will provide immediate results. This will increase testing capabilities in countries facing outbreaks, it says.

The WHO announced on Friday that it had approved the “real-time PCR test”, Alinity m MPXV assay, which enables the detection of the virus by testing swabs of skin lesions.

Currently, patients have to wait days for results. This test will help health workers confirm suspected cases more “efficiently”, the WHO said.

In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the epicentre of the current outbreak, only 37 percent of suspected cases have been tested this year, the United Nations health agency noted.

This test’s approval “will be pivotal in expanding diagnostic capacity in countries facing mpox outbreaks, where the need for quick and accurate testing has risen sharply,” it added in a statement.

Mpox, which is transmitted by human-to-human contact and contact with infected animals, has been detected in 16 African countries this year.

According to the African Union’s Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 800 people across the continent have died from the disease, which causes fever, aches and skin lesions.

“By detecting DNA from pustular or vesicular rash samples, laboratory and health workers can confirm suspected mpox cases efficiently and effectively,” the WHO said.

“Limited testing capacity and delays in confirming mpox cases persist in Africa, contributing to the continued spread of the virus,” it added.
## ‘Protecting people in underserved regions’

“This first mpox diagnostic test listed under the Emergency Use Listing (EUL) procedure represents a significant milestone in expanding testing availability in affected countries,” said Yukiko Nakatani, the WHO’s assistant director-general for access to medicines and health products.

The agency said it was evaluating three new mpox diagnostic tests for emergency use and was also in discussions with other manufacturers to expand the availability of mpox diagnostic tools.

In August, after the WHO declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years, it asked manufacturers to submit their products for an emergency review.

The EUL procedure is a risk-based assessment of unlicensed vaccines, tests and treatments to expedite their availability during public health emergencies.

Nakatani explained that the approval of the test increases “access to quality-assured medical products” and “is central to our efforts in assisting countries to contain the spread of the virus and protect their people, especially in underserved regions”.

The latest mpox outbreak began in theand later spread to neighbouring countries, including Burundi, Uganda and Rwanda.

So far, two strains of the virus are spreading: the clade 1 variant, which is endemic in parts of West and Central Africa, and clade 1b, a new, more infectious variant that has triggered international concern.

India, Thailand and Sweden have all reported cases of the clade 1b variant of mpox.
