The BBC has witnessed Israeli airstrikes around the city of Tyre, in southern Lebanon.

Correspondent Orla Guerin visited the usually crowded holiday destination, and said it is now "basically deserted", apart from people fleeing intense Israeli airstrikes in nearby towns.

Israel is carrying out "extensive" strikes in Lebanon after Hezbollah fires missile at Tel Aviv.

At least 23 people have been killed in the attacks, Lebanon's health ministry said.

China has said it successfully launched an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) carrying a dummy warhead into the Pacific Ocean.

The ICBM was launched at 08:44 local time (04:44 GMT) on Wednesday and "fell into expected sea areas", Beijing's defence ministry said, adding that the test launch was "routine" and part of its "annual training".

The type of missile and its flight path remained unclear, but Chinese state media said Beijing had "informed the countries concerned in advance".

Japan later said that it received "no notice" of the test launch.

China's nuclear weapon tests usually take place domestically, and it previously test-fired ICBMs west into the Taklamakan Desert in the Xinjiang region.

This is believed to be the first time since 1980 that it launched an ICBM into international waters.

"Unless I'm missing something, I think this is essentially the first time this has happened - and been announced as such - in a long time," Ankit Panda, a nuclear weapons specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, wrote on X.

He added that Beijing's description of the test as "routine" and "annual" was odd, "given that they don't do this sort of thing either routinely or annually".

The Japanese government said on Wednesday that China had given it no prior notice of the ICBM launch.

"There was no notice from the Chinese side in advance," government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters.

Japan's defence ministry had earlier said there was no damage to its vessels.

"We will continue to collect and analyse information on the movements of the Chinese military and will take all possible precautions in our vigilance and monitoring," the ministry said early Wednesday afternoon, according to Japanese broadcaster NHK.

When China last did such a test - in May 1980 - the ICBM flew 9,070km and landed in the Pacific. That test involved 18 Chinese naval ships and is still considered one of China's biggest naval missions.

"Timing is everything," Drew Thompson, a visiting research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore, wrote on X.

"[China's] statement claims the launch does not target any country, but there are high-levels of tension between China and Japan, Philippines, and of course perpetual tension with Taiwan."

"The launch is a powerful signal intended to intimidate everyone," he added.

John Ridge, a US-based defence analyst, said China could have conducted the test as a form of "posturing or signalling to the United States".

While the relationship between Beijing and Washington has improved in the past year, China's increasing assertiveness in the region remains a sticking point.

Tensions have ramped up betweenias their ships have repeatedly collided in disputed waters. Last month,after it accused a Chinese spy plane of breaching its air space, a move that it called "utterly unacceptable".

Beijing's claims over self-governed Taiwan have been another source of strain.

Taiwan's defence ministry said earlier on Wednesday that China had been carrying out "intensive" missile firing and other drills recently. In the same statement, the ministry said it had detected 23 Chinese military aircraft operating around Taiwan on "long-range missions".

Beijing routinely sends ships and aircraft into Taiwanese waters and airspace in what analysts say is a "greyzone warfare" tactic meant to normalise the incursions.

In July this year, China suspended its nuclear arms control talks with Washington, in retaliation for the.

Last year, ChinaRocket Force unit - the elite unit managing its nuclear arsenal - over corruption allegations.

In a report published last year, the Pentagon estimated that China hasin its arsenal, of which approximately 350 are ICBMs.

The report also projected that China will reach over 1,000 warheads by 2030. Still, that is a fraction of the more than 5,000 warheads that the US and Russia each say they possess.

A surge in demand for artificial intelligence-focused semiconductors and AI-enabled smartphones and laptops could lead to the next global chip shortage, according to a report released Wednesday by consultancy Bain & Company.

The last major semiconductor shortage happened during the Covid-19 pandemic amid supply chain disruption and a rise in demand for consumer electronics as people were forced to stay and work at home.

Technology giants have been snapping up graphics processing units, or GPUs, mainly from. These GPUs which are housed in data centers are critical for the training of huge AI models which underpin applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT.

Meanwhile, companies likeare designing chips that go into smartphones and personal computers and allow those devices torather than via an internet connection in the cloud. These are often referred to as AI-enabled devices and companies from Samsung tohave released such products.

Bain said demand for GPUs and AI consumer electronics could be the cause of a chip shortage.

"Surging demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) has caused shortages in specific elements of the semiconductor value chain," Anne Hoecker, head of the technology practice in the Americas at Bain & Company, told CNBC by email.

"If we combine the growth in demand for GPUs alongside a wave of AI-enabled devices, which could accelerate PC product refresh cycles, there could be more widespread constraints on semiconductor supply."

However, it'show much demand such AI-enabled gadgets will have, given what appears to be a cautious approach to them from consumers so far.

Bain & Company noted that the semiconductor supply chain is "incredibly complex, and a demand increase of about 20% or more has a high likelihood of upsetting the equilibrium and causing a chip shortage."

"The AI explosion across the confluence of the large end markets could easily surpass that threshold, creating vulnerable chokepoints throughout the supply chain," the report added.

The semiconductor supply chain is spread across multiple companies. For example, while Nvidia might design its GPUs, they are made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., or, in Taiwan. TSMCfrom countries around the world, such as the Netherlands. Furthermore, the most cutting-edge chips.

Geopolitics could also be a factor prompting a chip shortage. Semiconductors are seen by governments around the world as strategic technology. The U.S. has been on a campaign,, of trying to restrict China's access to the most advanced chips. Meanwhile, Washington has sought to shore up its own domestic capacity to produce semiconductors.

"Geopolitical tensions, trade restrictions, and multinational tech companies' decoupling of their
supply chains from China continue to pose serious risks to semiconductor supply. Delays in factory construction, materials shortages, and other unpredictable factors could also create pinch points," Bain & Company said.

announced Tuesday it has picked 10-year veteran, and current Chief Financial Officer Bettina Orlopp to helm the bank as chief executive as it seeks to fend off a potential hostile takeover from Italian bank UniCredit.

The bank has been on the defensive aslooks to become its largest shareholder, signaling the potential for a full takeover.

Earlier this month, the Milan-based bank started building its shareholding with a 9% stake in Commerzbank.then announced this week it had acquired additional Commerzbank shares, taking its stake in the German lender to around 21%, and submitted a request to increase its holdings to 29.9%.

Senior officials at Commerzbank and the German government, which was the company's largest shareholder until UniCredit stepped in, have both said they oppose a hostile takeover. Orlopp will now be put in charge of leading the fight.

Commerzbankin a late Tuesday statement that its supervisory board is aiming for current Chief Executive Manfred Knof to hand over his duties to Orlopp, "in the near future." The firm added that the board had agreed unanimously on Orlopp succeeding Knof after an internal and external search for candidates.

Later on Wednesday the bank announced Knof will leave the company at the end of the month on September 30.

Orlopp's contract is set out for five years, Commerzbank said, noting that the search for her replacement as CFO is still underway. The CFO said she was "looking forward to this new challenge," while also noting that "significant tasks lie ahead."

"Together with all our key partners, we will navigate through the challenges ahead of us successfully," she said.

## Need for a 'credible CEO'

, Orlopp has been Commerzbank's CFO, covering finance, investor relations, tax and treasury departments, according to her. Most recently she was also the deputy chairwoman of the board of directors at the German bank, a position she has held.

The 54-year-old banker initially joined Commerzbank in 2014 as a divisional board member for group development and strategy. Since then, Orlopp has worked as an executive board member and then member of the board of managing directors overseeing areas including compliance, legal and human resources divisions.

Prior to her time at Commerzbank, Orlopp worked at McKinsey for 19 years. She holds a business administration diploma from the University of Regensburg, where she also completed a doctorate in finance.

Orlopp told journalists last week that current developments with UniCredit were unexpected, but urged calm.

"We have all been very surprised by the process," she said according to. "That's why the most important thing now is simply to sort it out calmly, to think about what's on the table now and how to deal with it," she added.

Other officials at Commerzbank have been more direct in sharing their concerns about a tie-up with the Italian bank. Stefan Wittman, supervisory board member at Commerzbank, on Tuesday"we certainly hope we can avoid" a hostile takeover and warned that major job losses could occur if UniCredit took over.

This is not Orlopp's first tumultuous time at Commerzbank. She was at the bank when it began the process of restructuring in 2016 and throughout periods of merger considerations,in 2018 and 2019.

When Orlopp became CFO in 2020, the bank was facing pressure from U.S. private equity group Cerberus, which at the time held an around 5% stake in Commerzbank, according to Reuters. The activist investor demanded personnel and strategy — including cost cutting — changes at the German lender.

Thesaw both the CEO and chairman of the supervisory board at the time, resign from their positions. Knof was thenin 2020 and officially took on the role in 2021.

Thomas Schweppe, founder of 7Square, on Wednesday told CNBC that he believed it was important that the decision to make Orlopp CEO was taken quickly. "The situation is untenable. You cannot defend a company without a credible CEO," he said.

Orlopp's extensive experience at Commerzbank will allow her to hit the ground running, which is "very very important," Schweppe said.

"At the same time obviously she has been part of some decisions that potentially led to the, you know, difficult situation Commerzbank finds itself now in," he added.

*Co-leaders’ exits come after the party failed to cross five percent threshold in Thuringia and Brandenburg state polls.*

The co-leaders of Germany’s Greens party, which is part of Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s ruling coalition, have said they would quit after a series of election blows that saw their party ejected from two regional parliaments.

The decision made by Omid Nouripour and Ricarda Lang on Wednesday comes at a time of turbulence for the, buffeted by voter angst over the economic challenges facing Germany and by fierce debates over migration as a national election looms next year.

“The result in Brandenburg [in the regional election] on Sunday is a sign our party is in its deepest crisis of a decade,” Nouripour told a news conference. “It is time to lay our beloved party’s fate in others’ hands.”

In Thuringia and Brandenburg states, the Greensto cross the five percent threshold needed to enter parliament, and in Saxony, they just scraped in.

Co-leader Lang said the party “needs new faces to lead it out of this crisis” and oversee a “strategic reorientation” before the national poll.

Lang and Nouripour will remain in place until successors are elected at a party conference in mid-November.

The Greens emerged out of Germany’s environmental, peace and anti-nuclear protest movements of the 1970s, and participated in previous Social Democratic Party (SPD)-led national governments between 1998 and 2005.

While the Green party leadership’s move has no direct impact on the German government or on Greens ministers serving in it – including Scholz’s deputy Robert Habeck and Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock – analysts said it could stoke greater political instability.

Habeck said he shared responsibility for the poor election results and called for an open debate on the Greens’ future at their party congress in mid-November.

“The Greens will reorder their ranks to start the catch-up ahead of the elections with new force,” he added.

Meanwhile, the parliamentary leader of Scholz’s centre-left SPD, Katja Mast, said she believed the Greens would want to stay in the governing coalition.

The Greens need to adapt to a dramatically changed political climate, outgoing co-leader Lang said at Wednesday’s news conference.

“Next year’s election is not just any election,” she said. “[It will be a choice between] a country focused on achieving prosperity by sticking to climate neutrality or a country run by people who want to back away from all that.”

bib_key = "key-12"

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has been clear, tellingthat the world “cannot afford Lebanon to become another Gaza”.

Many prominent Israeli figures seem to want exactly that, however, drawing straight lines between Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon to underscore the threat they pose and justify assaults on Gaza and Lebanon.
## So, are Hamas and Hezbollah the same?

Not even a bit.

In Lebanon, Hezbollah is part of a wider tapestry of the political and military mosaic. While it plays a prominent role in the country, it does not have control over the presidency or parliament.

Unlike Gaza, Lebanon is present in international systems of governance and finance. Gaza and Hamas’s links with the international order are primarily via aid provided by organisations like the UN.

Hamas, which has an effective military wing like Hezbollah, governs Gaza completely and has to maintain a functioning society and governing structure.
## Aren’t they both ‘Iranian proxies’?

They’re allies, yes.

Israel has portrayed them as equal extensions of what is typically cast as Israel’s ultimate foe: Iran.

Addressing the, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran was behind everything and that its “proxy” forces – Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis in Yemen – pose an equal threat to Israel and, by extension, the West.

Both groups maintain strong alliances with Iran, but they are distinct from each other, and their relationship with Iran changes.

Hezbollah is more aligned with Iran’s regional goals, while Hamas utilises Iranian support but is more independent.

Hamas broke with Iranover its support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and it does not seem to have forewarned Iran of its October 7 attack on Israel.
## But they said both groups use human shields?

To justify its widespread targeting of civilian areas, Israel has accused both Hamas and Hezbollah of “hiding” their military hardware there.

Israel claims Hamas hides in or near schools, hospitals and homes as it tries to justify the destruction of Gaza.

It also claims Hamas uses UN facilities in Gaza as military fronts “in contravention of the Geneva Convention”.

Israel has also targeted the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) – the only support for Palestinian refugee populations displaced in the ethnic cleansing of 1948’s Nakba by Zionist gangs.

Recently, Israel made similar claims about homes in southern Israel – that they are being used by Hezbollah.

On Monday, Israel released images of what it said was a Hezbollah missile concealed in an attic in southern Lebanon, appearing to be trying to pre-empt criticism of its ongoing strikes.

Pointing to an image, an Israeli military spokesperson said, “It’s ready to launch from an opening in the roof.

“Under the attic, on the first floor, a Lebanese family lives, serving as a human shield.”

At the time of writing, Israel has carried out thousands of strikes on homes across Lebanon.
## But what about civilians?

In Gaza, Israel has shown little concern for fatalities – bombing homes, displacement camps, hospitals and schools.

In Lebanon, Israel sent opaque “evacuation notices” to the citizens of a foreign country ahead of strikes on targets the people may not know are nearby.

The paper notices, text messages and recorded phone calls were cited by Israel as “evidence” that it is trying to avoid civilian casualties.

During a visit to a military base on Tuesday, Netanyahu told the people of Lebanon “our war is not with you; our war is with Hezbollah”, urging the Lebanese people to rise up against the group.

At the time of writing, more than 600 people in Lebanon have been killed in the ongoing Israeli strikes and more than 2,000 injured.
## Are people in Lebanon displaced as in Gaza?

Yes.

In an echo of the attack on Gaza, thousands of terrified Lebanese families have fled southern Lebanon, joining an estimated 110,000 people who fled earlier, seeking shelter wherever possible.

The total number of displaced is about 500,000 now, Lebanon’s Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib said on Tuesday.

Someseeking shelter in Palestinian refugee camps in southern Beirut like Shatila – camps that have housed Palestinians fleeing Israeli attacks since the 1940s.

Others are cramming into bomb shelters, sleeping in cars, or crowding into Beirut’s schools, which, unlike the UNRWA-operated schools in Gaza, were never designed to double as shelters.
## If they’re so different, why are Israel’s tactics the same?

Because Israel needs a quick end and thinks this will work, said Yousef Munayyer from the Arab Center Washington DC.

In Gaza, Hamas survived a year of Israeli attacks by relying on its tunnel network.

Hezbollah says it has an expansive network of tunnels in Lebanon with extensive munitions in them,.

Israel would struggle more in Lebanon, not least because Hezbollah is stronger.

“And so they’re using the same sort of tactics that they used in Gaza,” Munayyer said. “This is part of an Israeli strategy aimed at bringing great pressure on Hezbollah.”

He said Israel hoped to “get out of the situation without a ground invasion, without a long drawn-out battle” – and to avoid getting bogged down in Lebanon just as it has in Gaza."""

Iran says Israel wants to trap it into a direct conflict by bombing Hezbollah, even as a new Iranian president tries outreach to the West.

Steven Erlanger, who covered the Iranian revolution of 1978-79, has been writing about the Middle East and its diplomacy for decades.

Sept. 25, 2024Updated7:17 a.m. ET

Israel’sis another embarrassment for Iran and its new president, raising the pressure on him to strike back at Israel to defend an important ally.

Iran has so far refused to be goaded by Israel into a larger regional war that its supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, clearly does not want, analysts say. Instead, Presidentis at the United Nations hoping to present a more moderate face to the world and meeting European diplomats in the hopes of restartingthat could lead to vital sanctions relief for.

In New York this week, Mr. Pezeshkian was blunt. Israel was seeking to trap his country into a wider war, he said. “It is Israel that seeks to create this all-out conflict,”. “They are dragging us to a point where we do not wish to go.”

After a series of humiliations, heightened by Israel’s intensified attacks on Hezbollah, Iran faces clear dilemmas.

It wants to restore deterrence against Israel while avoiding a full-scale war between the two countries that could draw in the United States and, in combination, destroy the Islamic Republic at home.

It wants to preserve the proxies that provide what it calls forward defense against Israel — Hezbollah, Hamas and the Houthis in Yemen — without going into battle on their behalf.

In the Electoral College, it doesn’t matter if you win a state by one vote or a million.Credit...Adriana Zehbrauskas for The New York Times

Ever since Donald J. Trump’sin 2016 — when he lost the popular vote by almost three million votes but still triumphed with over 300 electoral votes — many who follow politics have believed Republicans hold an intractable advantage in the Electoral College.

But there’s growing evidence to support a surprising possibility: His once formidable advantage in the Electoral College is not as ironclad as many presumed. Instead, it might be shrinking.

According to The New York Times’s, it does not seem that Kamala Harris will necessarily need to win the popular vote by much to prevail.

The simplest way to measure the advantage in the Electoral College is to take the difference between the national popular vote and the vote in the “tipping-point” state (the state that puts one candidate over the top in the Electoral College). Right now, Vice President Harris leads the polling in the national vote by 2.6 percentage points, and leads— the current tipping-point state — by 1.8 points, which makes Mr. Trump’s advantage less than a point.

By this measure, Mr. Trump’s advantage is only around one-fifth as large as it was four years ago, when President Biden fared 3.8 points better nationally than in Wisconsin (the tipping-point state in 2020).

## Donald Trump Embraces ‘Love’

Politicians often lean toward hyperbole, but the frequent use of the word “love” in the former president’s fund-raising notes is an increasingly common tactic for him.

Sept. 25, 2024Updated9:48 a.m. ET

The emails have been pleading and plaintive.

“Listen, you know I love you,” a Sept. 6 missive read, adding, “I will always love you.”

Another, on Aug. 30, was even more heartfelt.

“I truly mean it when I say that I will always love and appreciate you.”

As recently as last week, the emotions continued to flow.

“I really do love you,” the email gushed. “I KNOW I JUST WON THE ELECTION!”

The writer in question? Donald J. Trump, who has peppered his pleas for donations with declarations of ardor for his followers in fund-raising pitches of late.

And while Mr. Trump’s tendency toward loving remarks to his supporters dates back years, the pace of such statements has intensified as the campaign rolls toward its conclusion and as he rails against Kamala Harris, whose campaign has made a point of emphasizingand

In the last nine days, Mr. Trump’s email blasts have told prospective donors he “loves” them at least 10 times, sometimes promising that his passion had nothing to do with his requests for money.
