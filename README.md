# feedpress
RSS to Newspaper Tooling

## Planning and Proof of Concepts
- Single text blurb to PDF with no layout
- Source RSS text from list and pull out content
- [typst](https://github.com/typst/typst) formatting and layout with callouts/includes to sections?
- feedpress.dev - site thoughts - should it be a single page with links to tooling releases?  A service? 


## Flow

- Source feeds
- Extract and process
- Collect and organize/layout
- Export
